Oborevwori stated this when he mounted the witness box for cross-examination in a suit brought before the court by Mr Novwie Ikie to challenge his eligibility on the allegation of a forged academic certificate which he presented for the upcoming election. The Governorship candidate who presented relevant documents to buttress his point affirmed that he was born in 1963 as against 1979, which was erroneously put in his certificate.
