He said: “The US do not have a preferred candidate, full stop! We are not interested in a particular party or candidate. What we are interested in is free,fair, and credible election that represents the people. “These elections are important.Nigeria is the fifth largest democracy in the world so when the people of Nigeria come to vote, you are showing the strength of democracy to the rest of the world.” He said the US had been working with the Nigeria government as partners to support the Independent Electoral Commission, INEC and civil society organizations to enable them hold candidates accountable. Stevens also disclosed that the US has provided nearly 50 million dollars in technical assistance to the electoral umpire to strengthen the mechanisms that will allow Nigerians feel comfortable that their votes will count . “We in the United States will discourage any politicians,citizens ,other parties who are encouraging electoral violence or seeking to undermine the electoral process. “One thing we have done in the past and continue to do is that those who seek to undermine the democratic process can and will be found ineligible for visa to the US,” he said. Stevens said his mission to Delta state and the South-East was for pre election monitoring with a view to looking and seeing how things are developing. He added that the consulate is doing all within its powers to understand what is happening and articulate such to US citizens.  ...says does not have preffered candidate, political party  ...As Oborevwori, Omo-Agege, Ofehe, others sign OpenGov manifesto  By Festus Ahon, ASABA  THE United States government, has warned that it would refuse visas for anyone found culpable in encouraging electoral violence or undermining the 2023 process, insisting that it neither had a… In "News" 2023: US vows to deny violators of electoral process visas In "News" THERE seems to be confusion and uncertainty in Delta State, following the omission of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP and its gubernatorial candidate in the list of political parties and candidates published by the Independent Electoral Commission, INEC, Friday.
