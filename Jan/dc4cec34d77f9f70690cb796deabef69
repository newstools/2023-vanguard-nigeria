His people beckon on him to represent them as the councillor in the local government. He tries to make them see how dirty the games of politics can be since he is a Christian. While the lead actor resists his people’s demands, his mother eggs him on to grab the wealth-making opportunity as his life changer. Joining Nollywood in the mid-2000s, Chief Imo as he’s fondly called by his fans switched to acting in 2008. Today, he’s best known for his original comedy in the Igbo language that thrills movie enthusiasts in the eastern part of Nigeria. Realling how he began his acting career, the Imo state-born actor said “Everything started when I was in elementary school and extended to secondary school.” “Each time I come out to talk, people would laugh at me. On many occasions, I would end up cracking jokes to a large audience while responding to a question. Gradually, I started building my acting career.” “When I was coming up, my wife was discouraged because of how rough things were with me. “At a point, I came to terms with what they were saying, especially when I saw nothing was coming out from the work and no help came from anywhere after releasing my first album,” he narrated. Chief Imo, however, weathered the storms and the rest is history today. Despite striking the right note, this comedian isn’t backing down any time soon. His new music, Good News reminds him of the many hurdles he was fazed with as a budding entertainer in his village.  Delectable Nollywood actress, Amaka Obi is far from being tagged a greenhorn in the movie industry, not only because she produced her first movie some six years ago, but also because the Mbaise, Imo State beauty has a couple of feats to brandish when it comes to some pioneering efforts… In "Home Video People" Imo State Government has said that the Governorâ€™s wife, Mrs. Chioma Ohakim, last visited London in September 2009, as a private citizen and never addressed anybody or group in London this year on any national issue. In "Latest News" The Deputy Governor of Imo state, Eze Madumere, yesterday, visited the APC state secretariat in the state, to plead with members of APC to encourage other people to join the party.
