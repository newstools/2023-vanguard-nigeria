Professor Ibe said the action was in honour of the late Ikonne who he said was a fellow governorship flag bearer, university don and illustrious son of Abia. This is as the former Leader, ECOWAS Parliament and the PDP senatorial candidate for Abia North, Senator Mao Ohuabunwa, has expressed rude shock over Ikonne’s demise. Similarly, the governorship candidate of Action Alliance, AA, Onyekwere Akym Uche (OAU), has described Ikonne’s death as unfortunate and saddening. In the same vein, Accord Party governorship candidate, Bishop Dr Emeka Nwankpa, who described Ikonne as a worthy brother, said his death was a rude shock to him. “Nothing could be more saddening than the news of the death of Prof Uche Ikonne. He was a worthy brother. Though we were political opponents, we had mutual respect for each other. I needed him alive to join me in building a new Abia State when I become Governor”, Nwankpa said. Professor Ibe, in a statement by the Director General of his Campaign Organization, Dr Longman Nwachukwu, commiserated with the Ikonne’s family, Abia State Government and the PDP over the death of the former Vice Chancellor. He said that Professor Ikonne would be remembered for his numerous contributions to the development of our dear state especially as the Vice Chancellor of the Abia State University Uturu. “As a mark of honour to the late Ikonne who was a fellow governorship candidate and colleague in the academic profession, Professor Ibe has announced immediate suspension of all his political activities including publication of campaign materials and transmission of radio jingles till further notice”, the statement said.
