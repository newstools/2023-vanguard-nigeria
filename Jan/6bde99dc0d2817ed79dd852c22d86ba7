Italian actress, Gina Lollobrigida, also known as the most beautiful woman in the world, has died at the age of 95.  According to BBC news, Corriere della Sera reported the news, saying she had been “hospitalised for some time”. Gina Lollobrigida was one of the brightest stars of European cinema in the 1950s and 1960s. Her roles in Crossed Swords, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, and Beautiful But Dangerous earned her the title of “the most beautiful lady in the world.” She appeared in films with actors such as Errol Flynn, Frank Sinatra, Rock Hudson, and Humphrey Bogart.
