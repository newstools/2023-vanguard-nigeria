A Pastor was also reported to have been injured during the attack. Bello Bello, the Chairman of Community Policing Relation in Kankara LGA who confirmed the report to Vanguard said those kidnapped were all females. Bello however debunked an earlier report credited to Rev. Ishaya Jurau, the Senior Special Assistant on Christian Affairs to Governor Aminu Bello Masari that the hoodlums kidnapped the worshippers right inside the New Life Church located at Gidan Haruna. Another source from the area who confirmed the attack to Vanguard but does not want his name in print said those kidnapped included six married women and two single ladies. He however said the attack took place inside the church contrary to what Bello said. “The bandits came to the church riding on nine motorcycles and surrounded the church. Then they started forcing the members out of the church but the Pastor tried to prevent them. So, they beat him up and broke his leg before disappearing with the six married women and two single ladies from the church premise. According to the source, they  are being constantly harassed  on daily basis by the bandits to the point that they are fed up and wish they could run away from the community. Vanguard in the course of digging into the matter learnt that the hoodlums just yesterday released two members from the area kidnapped about seven weeks ago after collecting an undisclosed amount as ransom.
