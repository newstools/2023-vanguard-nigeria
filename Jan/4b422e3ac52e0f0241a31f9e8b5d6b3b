Commenting, Okunnu-Lamidi said her appointment as the SDP presidential campaign deputy DG was an effort in the right direction. Okunnu-Lamidi promised to work diligently to execute the mandate of the party and the zealous mission of their candidates to protect the most vulnerable members of the communities. “I am immensely grateful for the high confidence the National Working Committee of our great SDP demonstrated in me with this critical appointment as Deputy DG of our winning presidential campaign. “I am honoured by the opportunity to serve our nation and the SDP in the mission to reinstate the honor of our peoples and the seemingly elusive promise of our nationhood. “I believe in Nigeria, in the drive and energy of our people, their sterling character and unbreakable resilience, their faith in themselves and in the unlimited talents with which the Almighty has endowed us. “I join this campaign to help in correcting the existing state of affairs built to dash the hopes of our people,” she said. She added: “I am bound to honour the trust that has been reposed in me with diligence, the same high character and sense of responsibility that is exemplified by our candidate and the next President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria: Prince Adewole Adebayo.” On the 2023 election, Okunnu-Lamidi called on members of the political class to become alive to their duties. She said the campaign was to meet the mandate of an electorate which was eager for practical reforms in the economy, security and governance. “I will consolidate the energy and talents and redirect the course of the nation’s history,” she said.
