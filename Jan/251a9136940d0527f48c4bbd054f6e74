Senator Ohuabunwa who spoke during his adoption by Arochukwu Youths Forum as their consensus candidate for the February 25 Abia North senatorial contest, said that those who opposed the introduction of technology into our electoral system were the real enemies of Nigeria’s democracy.

He thanked Arochukwu youths for their unwaivering support to his senatorial bid, pledging to restore the dignity and prestige of Abia North if returned to the Senate. The former Leader ECOWAS Parliament, regretted that since his exit from the red chamber in 2019, Abia North had not only become voiceless but a comic relief at the Senate.

He urged the people to collect their Permanent Voter Cards, PVCs, to enable them exercise their franchise in the forthcoming polls. Senator Ohuabunwa also commended the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, for the commission’s avowed commitments towards conducting a credible poll in 2023.

Earlier in his address, Director General of All Arochukwu LGA Youths Forum, Hon. Godwin Nwaka, said that Ohuabunwa’s return to the Senate had become a common project of all Arochukwu youths home and abroad. He said that the history of Ndigbo would not be complete without the historic role of the Aro kingdom, hence, “we will not let our presence in Nigeria politics to go into extinction”. The Youth Leader regretted that Abia North had been relegated to the background “since the mistake of 2019”, and urged the people to rise for a change. He declared the resolve of Aro youths to mobilize all eligible voters in the entire five clans of Arochukwu for a block vote for Ohuabunwa who he said is a seasoned and fearless Parliamentarian. Other speakers for all five clans in Arochukwu including former Deputy Chairman of the Council, Hon. Cletus Nwankwo, Tony Okoro, and Dr Tom Ezeikpe, pledged the support of their respective clans for Ohuabunwa. They vowed never to vote for any” Ruga promoter” at the forthcoming poll. Ezeikpe who was the Legislative Aide to the late Senator Uche Chukwumerije regretted that “Arochukwu is now being accessed through Akwa Ibom because Ohuabunwa’s successor abandoned the Ohafia -Arochukwu federal road project attracted by Ohuabunwa in 2018.” Earlier in his remarks, Chairman of the event, Eustace Njaka, lawyer and an industrialist, described Ohuabunwa as “Abia North ‘s first eleven that must not stay on the bench “. He stressed the need for aggressive voter education for the less- informed folks on the party logos to avoid waisting their ballots.
