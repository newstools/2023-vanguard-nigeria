I advise those who did not succeed during the party primaries to close ranks with our party flag bearers so as to enable the PDP win the 2023 general elections in the state. “As our party, the PDP prepares to launch her electioneering campaigns, I call on all party faithfuls to gear up to offer unflinching and unalloyed support and solidarity to all the candidates of our great party in the 2023 Elections. This is the only way to rescue Ebonyi state from the hands of the APC led government. “I hereby formally declare my total support for the PDP Governorship candidate, Dr Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odii and all other candidates of our party.
