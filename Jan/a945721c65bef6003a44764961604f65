Ayom noted that with Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu as President and Rev. Fr. Dr. Hyacinth Iormem Alia, as Benue state governor, the state will witness unprecedented development. He also enjoined the people of the Middle-belt to queue behind the former Lagos State Governor, who has over the years demonstrated an uncommon ability to provide leadership and mentor others for leadership positions. The former Presidential aspirant said this in an address to party supporters in Gboko, on Thursday. Ayom, who is an Abuja-based real estate developer and businessman said the two men have all it takes to take the nation and the Benue State to the next level.

Abdullahi Adamu the current national Chairman of the All Progressive Congress. He promised to use his contacts with the Chinese to assist the in coming APC-led administration the state to attract foreign investments to end the cycle of unpaid salaries, allowances and pensions. Ayom said, “The Chinese will be doing this in appreciation of the MOUs the APC led government of president Muhammadu Buhari-led delegation signed during his visit to China, in 2016. “If the people of the Middle belt want to take their rightful place in the current political arrangement in Nigeria, Asiwaju remains our best bet.”  Adamu By Dirisu Yakubu, Abuja Presidential hopeful on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Moses Ayom, has urged the party's national chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, to join the 2023  race for the Presidency.
