Prof. Adeyeye, who attributed the high rate of kidney problems in Nigeria to prolonged fasting by some religious adherents, insisted that those subjecting themselves to prolonged fasting on religious grounds must moderate the act. She spoke in Abuja yesterday, while briefing the media on the breakthrough by her agency in tracking a high consignments of Tramadol and other pharmaceuticals to the Republic of Benin. On the high rate of kidney problems in the country, she said:  “Kidney failure, we are a very religious country- Muslims and Christians fast a lot and it is part of the kidney problem. “Your body has to have homeomistatic balance, meaning that the water level in your body must be enough to make your organs to function. “Some people will fast for 10 or 20 days and drink only little water, the kidney is being punished. Now, if you put chemicals in it, it triples in exponential manner, it damages the kidney because the kidney doesn’t have water to dilute and filter.” Adeyeye, who tasked Nigerians to fast but with common sense, added:  “I fast but with common sense. We have to fast with common sense, otherwise we will pay with our kidneys.”  The National Agency for Food Drug Administration Control, NAFDAC, Monday blamed the sharp rise in cases of kidney and liver diseases among Nigerians on illicit cooking practices, poverty and ignorance.
