This disclaimer is to publicly debunk the unsubstantiated and malicious claim as such publication or future publication(s) do not represent the true state of affairs. TRJ Company Limited as with other companies is not insulated from the harsh economic climate ravaging the business ecosystem. However, as a law abiding corporate citizen, it has remained forthcoming and upfront in engaging with its customers in navigating through the economic murky waters. Members of the public are therefore advised to disregard this as fake news as we take appropriate steps in protecting and enforcing our clients’ rights in an appropriate forum.
