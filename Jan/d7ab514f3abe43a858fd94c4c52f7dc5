Winger Solly March scored twice and created a third for Brighton as they dominated the game from start to finish, with Liverpool barely able to string together a single decent attack. “Massively frustrated. Congratulations to Brighton on a super game against a bad opponent. We were not good today, I can’t remember a good phase or period,” an irate Klopp said. “Doing better than today should be easy, because this is a really low point. I can’t remember a worse game,” he added. In spite of losing 1-3 to Brentford in their last Premier League game on Jan. 2, Klopp said that he had been confident coming in to Saturday’s game. He said he was confident that his side could get a much-needed win. “There was no sign for this performance before the game. But that’s probably how it is sometimes. There’s nothing that I thought yesterday (Friday) or this (Saturday) morning that this could happen.” Liverpool’s campaign has been derailed by poor performances and injuries to key players. Team captain Virgil van Dijk is missing due to a hamstring strain, while recent signing Cody Gakpo started upfront due to the absence of Darwin Nunez. As a result, the Reds struggled to maintain possession and Brighton were able to make the most of the chances they were offered. “In these moments we passed from the last line upfront, and then when we want to push up the ball was already gone again. So, that’s why it’s just counter (attacks) from their side and it always look horrible,” Klopp said.
