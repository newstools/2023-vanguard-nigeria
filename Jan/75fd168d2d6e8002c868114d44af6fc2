Today at Kofar Kaura in Katsina State Capital, some hoodlums together with underage children, mostly Almajiris’ took to the street throwing stones shortly after President Muhammadu Buhari commissioned the underpass bridge located in the neighbourhood. Vanguard learnt that the hoodlums littered the scene throwing stones and chanting in Hausa ‘Bamuyi bamuyi’, meaning ‘we are not interested.’ According to an eyewitness, it took the intervention of vigilantes in conjunction with security personnels to calm the situation which lasted for over thirty minutes. Some journalists trailing the president to cover his activities were reportedly caught in the web as police tried to disperse the hoodlums with tear gas.
