The one I elected as president, surrender yourself to him for I’m the one who put him as president. “To the Christian in the world, your work is not yet sufficient, therefore, work, win Souls and raise war against Satan. I unleashed power upon this year. More souls shall be won to my kingdom this year. There will be many challenges but I’m with you. I take all the glory though you will be fought. I will move to the nation I have not been. I can see many temples as the habitation of SATAN but many have fallen.Let There be repentance for Many temple will be the habitation of Satan. I’m no more there. “I will expose many things in the Christian body. I can see more separation among you because majority among you are of the devil. Many of you eat on devil’s table. I will disgrace many who don’t believe in my name. Many secret of the leaders shall be exposed.I do not think like a human.I will turn to you if you turn back to me.” And to the church, God said they should should continue with the work of God saying “Continue with your work for me but let it be diligent because your work is not enough for me.

Get prepared for international connection even as I have promised last year.I bring more fulfilment, be ye fruitful to me.

Amend your ways and allow nothing to enter you through loopholes.My doctrine cannot be changed, flee from sin and uphold my law in various assembly. Teach them the truth without hiding anything for I have chosen you, deliver, do unusual thing, tear apart, uphold, I will uphold, establish and I will establish, uproot and I will uproot.
