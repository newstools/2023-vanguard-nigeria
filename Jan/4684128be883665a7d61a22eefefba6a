Onoh in his reply to Shaibu noted that the production vacuum created by global chip shortage has opened an opportunity for divestiture that many companies are jumping on, explaining that from existing semiconductor companies working on production expansion to tech companies delving into chip manufacturing, the semiconductor industry is witnessing an uptick in investment interest. According to him, Semiconductors are the brains of modern electronics that make the world go round; found everywhere and whose increasing demand is driven by growth in the industrial, automotive, cloud and network infrastructure industries. He said that for several years now, Nigeria has been vocal on ‘Transfer of Technology’ which even though is a good idea, has not been transferred because no one gives his secret of success and livelihood to another. Onoh said: “Our opponents are only envious that Asiwaju has more vision than them. The technology so sought must be homegrown of which we have available resources in Nigeria for Microelectronic manufacturing which formed the basis of Asiwaju’s promise to engage yahoo boys positively transforming a mindset of fraud to a mindset of endless productive possibilities. The production of semiconductor material is the basis for microelectronic manufacturing. All the semiconductor materials are identified, projections on their sources in Nigeria are available and methods for its preparation will be achieved by an Asiwaju presidency in the perspective of methods employed in developed economies. “Tinubu’s administration will aim to get at where in the manufacturing processes that Nigeria can deploy appropriate technology, ensuring that transfer of technology, homegrown, basis, and its sources in Nigeria. Currently, in world, digital electronics is the focus of technology. Micro- and Nanoelectronics command the present man-machine values. “Nigeria is one nation that has all the potential needed to manufacture personal, domestic, and industrial appliances from scratch to finish. A Tinubu presidency will definitely explore the possibilities for the complete manufacture of micro- and nano- electronics from the extraction of raw materials to the finished and refined semiconductor substrates; from constructing electronic components on the semiconductor substrates to a complete and functional integrated circuit or chip. This and more is contained in his manifesto, and with the support of all well-meaning Nigerians, we will achieve them. “To make a microelectronic circuit, the raw materials must be obtained. These raw materials are the semiconductors ores. These ores are obtained from sand at sea shores and can also be extracted from rocks of which in our Manifesto mining exploration was captured this goes a long way to affirm that Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu took time to study and sort solutions to the Nigeria problems of which lack of skills, low income and job creation is a major problem with the Nigeria youth which promoted the rise of the Yahoo fraud pandemic. “Currently, in Nigeria, we are blessed with good sandy beaches with crystalline sand and are littered all along the long stretch of coast line from Ogun State in South Western Nigeria to Cross- River State in the South-South of the country. If semiconductor ores are obtained from rocks, then Nigerians have everything it takes to get the ores in abundance. Rocks are found cladding all of the South East and the middle belt of Nigeria. And if you go to the northeast and east of the country, the whole stretch of land from Gwoza in Borno state to Obudu in Cross-River State is rocky and mountainous. Where on earth  do we have this vast source of Semiconductor materials? So, I assure Nigerians that a vote for Asiwaju guarantees a good deal for everyone. “From my explanation, it’s clear that no state will be left behind from the benefits of Asiwaju’s victory. His manifesto is the best. His track records are a success story, his vision for Nigeria is miles ahead, his word is his bond, and his campaign is miles ahead of the rest. Together, we will renew hope and build a Nigeria of our dreams which is far more honourable than electing a President who is more suited as a human Google tour guide operator around Dubai or a wrong statistician professor whom will send us on continuous verification exercises all through his administration and leave us Nigerians with only a beer factory to cool our thirst after roaming in the wilderness in quest of Go and verify.”  Spokesman of the Asiwaju Bola Tinubu campaign in the Southeast, Dr Josef Onoh has accused the Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of divisive politics, intended to engender ethnic suspicion among Nigerians.
