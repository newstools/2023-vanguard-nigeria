In a one-count charge filed before the court, the Lagos State Government alleged that Vandi shot and killed Mrs Raheem in the Ajah area of the state, on December 25, 2022. The offence, according to the state, is contrary to Section 223 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. After the charge was read in court, Vandi pleaded not guilty to the allegation. Lagos State Attorney-General, Moyosore Onigbanjo, who is prosecuting the case, subsequently told the court that the state was ready to commence trial and that they have a witness in court. The defence counsel, Mr Adetokunbo Odutola, who did not oppose the application, called for an accelerated hearing. Thereafter, a Police Inspector, Matthew Ameh was invited to the witness box. In his testimony, he told the court that his team, including the defendant, was deployed to Ajah under a bridge where they were conducting a stop and search. He told the court that his team tried to stop the deceased’s car which is an unregistered vehicle but that the driver didn’t stop and Vandi fired at the car. Trial judge, Justice Ibironke Harrison ordered an accelerated hearing in the matter and adjourned till January 25 and 26, 2023,  for cross-examination and continuation of trial. The arraignment, which was scheduled for 9 a.m., was delayed until about 11 a.m., when Vandi’s counsel, Odutola arrived. Recall that Vandi was arrested and arraigned before Chief Magistrate C.  Adedayo on December 30, 2022, a day after the Police Service Commission, PSC, approved his (Vandi) suspension. The Magistrate ordered that Vandi be remanded at the Ikoyi prison pending advice of the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions.
