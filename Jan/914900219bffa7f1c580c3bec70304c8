Reports suggested Ronaldo’s agreement included an additional bonus to act as an ambassador for Saudi Arabia’s World Cup bid, with the Middle East aiming to host another tournament after Qatar 2022. Al Nassr strongly denied claims Ronaldo had been offered a financial incentive to secure FIFA’s top tournament, with Spain, Ukraine and his home country Portugal among the others to make a joint bid to host.
