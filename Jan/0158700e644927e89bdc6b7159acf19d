The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in its Economic Report for October, 2022 released yesterday, showed that export receipts rose YoY  by 14 percent to $54.21 billion in 2022 from $47.46 billion in the corresponding period of 2021. The report also shows that merchandise imports rose YoY by 1.47 percent to $42.61 billion in 10 M’22 from $41.99 billion in the period. In the report, CBN noted that Nigeria’s trade surplus fell month-on-month (MoM) by 93.7 percent to $50 million in October 2022 from $750 million in September 2022 amidst  higher import bills. According to CBN, import increased by 34.9 per cent to $4.64 billion driven by the rise in the import of petroleum products to $1.24 billion from $120 million in September. CBN said: “Available data shows a decline of 93.7 per cent in trade surplus to $0.05 billion, from $0.75 billion in the preceding period. “Aggregate export receipts rose by 11.9 per cent to $4.69 billion, relative to $4.19 billion in September 2022. Similarly, merchandise import rose by 34.9 per cent to $4.64 billion, from $3.44 billion in September 2022.” However, the data indicated impressive developments in crude oil trade as, according to CBN, the decision by the Oil Producing and Exporting Countries, OPEC+ to cut global production by 2mb/d from November 2022 stoked higher crude oil prices at the international market, thereby resulting in improved crude oil export earnings.
