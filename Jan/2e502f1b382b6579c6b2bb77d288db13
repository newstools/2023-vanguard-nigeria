The Anambra State Signage and Advertisement Agency had last week, dismantled the campaign billboard of Peter Obi. The large billboard situated at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University temporary site flyover was pulled down on Saturday over the alleged failure of the party to meet requirements. Recall that in August 2022, the Anambra State Government directed that all presidential, senatorial and House of Representative candidates will pay the sum of N10m, N7m, and N5m respectively while candidates of the State House of Assembly will pay N1m to mount billboards in any part of the state. Following the removal on Saturday, the coalition of Igbo youths condemned the action of the governor, stating that if the billboard is not restored, the governor would face the consequences. In a statement issued yesterday by its President General, Goodluck Ibem, the coalition said: “The illegal action by Governor Charles Soludo to remove campaign billboards of these noble candidates because they are not in his political party is unconstitutional and undemocratic, to say the least. “We are aware that  Governor Soludo is after Mr Peter Obi and Senator Victor Umeh because these two personalities represent integrity, sincerity and transparency which is a variant of what Soludo believes in. “We give Governor Soludo 48 hours to replace those billboards of Mr Peter Obi and Senator Victor Umeh which he illegally removed or face the wrath of the youths.”  Anti-Obi epistle: Resign or we fill Anambra govt house with refuse, Igbo youths tell Soludo In "News" By Vincent Ujumadu Awka—THE Coalition of South East Youth Leaders, COSEYL, a socio-cultural group, has threatened to organize mass dumping of wastes at the Government House, Awka, on November 25 to drive home their anger against the state governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo for his comments over the presidential candidate of the… In "News" By Vincent Ujumadu Awka- THE campaign billboards of the presidential candidate of Labour Party (LP), Mr. Peter Obi and that of the party's senatorial candidate for Anambra Central, Senator Victor Umeh, mounted on the pedestrian flyover along the popular UNIZIK junction in Awka, have been pulled down on the alleged… In "Politics"
