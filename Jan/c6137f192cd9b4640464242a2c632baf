Paris Saint Germain have officially confirmed French star, Kylian Mbappé as the new club’s vice-captain. Christophe Galtier, the club’s gaffer, confirmed this on Monday after PSG’s 7-0 win over Pays de Cassel in the Coupe de France. Mbappe wore the captain’s armband for the game – in the absence of Marquinhos – and netted five goals as they trounced the sixth-tier side at RC Lens’ Stade Bollaert Delelis.
