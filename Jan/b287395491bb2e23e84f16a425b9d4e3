He stressed the need for massive food production to tackle food price hikes and food security. Speaking at the annual stakeholders meeting of the African Agri-food Knowledge Transfer Partnership Programme (AAKTP), held at the OAU Conference Centre on Tuesday, he said massive food production will enhance healthy competition that could eventually lead to price stability and control.
