It is clear that even when he was a deputy rector before ascending to the position of a Rector, he was always opposed to the wellbeing of Nigeria students and preferred to be using such projects as a conduit pipe to drain resources.  “We want to opine in strong terms that, the present Rector must be compelled by the appropriate quarters to submit for onward review the BOQ submitted by KYC interproject, to Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) and the Federal Ministry of Education inorder to help meet up with the shortfall of students accommodation, to curb the problem of transportation, insecurity and rent outside the campus. The hostels to be renovated and upgraded with state of the art aesthetics is Eighteen blocks(18) with four thousand bed space(capacity). “NAPS is calling and appealing in strong terms to NBTE, the federal government and Federal Ministry of Education, on the urgent need to call to a roundtable the contractor KYC interproject, to revisit and focus it’s lens on the plan submitted and, allow the company to move to site, since it has been sinking it’s personal funds based on PPP concession. “Personal interest by the leadership of Kaduna Polytechnic management should not stall the already standard raised by KYC Interproject, else any plan to compromise the already signed agreement, will be left with no option than to mobilize the entire students for a total and indefinite shutdown of Kaduna Polytechnic.”  The Kaduna Polytechnic, KADPOLY, in Northwest Nigeria has taken all necessary measures to reopen responsibly, once the Federal Government gives the permission to do so, Rector of the Polytechnic, Professor Idris Bugaje has said.
