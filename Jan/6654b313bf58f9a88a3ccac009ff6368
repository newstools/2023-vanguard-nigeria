By Ada Osadebe Nollywood ace actress, Patience Ozokwo, has revealed why she did not remarry, after the death of her husband years ago. The actress made the revelation on Thursday during her chat on Mercy Johnson’s weekly cooking show, ‘Mercy’s Menu’. The Nollywood matriarch said her children begged her not to, promising to be there for her. Patience Ozokwo said, “I wanted to remarry, but my kids had already come of age and they pleaded with me not to marry another man. “And they promised that they will be my husband. “They asked me to stay single for them so their friends will not laugh at them; that at their age their mum remarried. “I understood them. Though it was selfish of them, but I paid the huge sacrifice for them. No sacrifice is too huge for family.” The veteran thespian also reflected on how she counseled Mercy to cease indecent dressing. Patience Ozokwo said, “Do you remember when you were younger before you got married when I told you that the photos you take today, your children will see them tomorrow and ask, immediately, the kind of lifestyle you lived.” Mercy Johnson, in response, acknowledged the statement. She said: “Yes you did. You told me, Mercy dress properly, you will have kids and when they grow up, they will ask you, why are you looking this way. “Yes, I remember.
