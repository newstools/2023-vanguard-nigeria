The communities, while rejecting other political parties in the area, also commended the PDP for the impressive human empowerment it had brought to their people over the past 23 years. Speaking at the town hall meeting held at Obe town, headquarters of Nkanu West Central Development Centre, yesterday, stakeholders and representatives of the different bodies said they would vote for the PDP en bloc because of the positive impacts their people  were enjoying at present. They described themselves as great beneficiaries of the party in terms of appointments into key positions, employment, empowerment and economic growth. While addressing the large crowd at the event, the chairman of the council area, Uche Ejim stated that Mbah’s visit to his people had renewed their hope and faith in the party that more dividends of democracy will continue to pour in.  He described Mbah as part of the large family, saying the people had already taken ownership of the project. “Our votes will speak for us on the day of election, and we want to use our votes to re-affirm our appreciation to the party,” the chairman noted. Hon. Iloabuchi Aniagolu, member of the House of Assembly, who spoke at the gathering, declared that Mbah is a brand everyone will be glad to advertise, adding that his candidacy is enjoying massive acceptance among the people because of his excellent programmes.” The member representing Nkanu West/Nkanu East Federal Constituency in the National Assembly, Hon. Nnolim Nnaji enumerated the laudable projects enabled by the party in the area in recent years, while expressing confidence that Mbah would win in a landslide. Presenting the priority needs of the development centre, titled “Community Charter of Demand “, their spokesperson, Hon. Dr. Kingsley Udeh appealed to Mbah to support their people in raising millionaires and billionaires by supporting their businesses and ventures in line with his economic blueprint for wealth creation. Dr Udeh, who is the Enugu State Commissioner of Rural Development, further urged the governorship frontrunner to build a new modern city with residential, recreational and industrial layouts within the Ozalla-Udi Road forest, construct a flyover at the Four-Corners Express Junction to address the menace of traffic gridlock and accidents on the axis, and complete the  RAMP-constructed earth roads linking Ozalla, Obe and Amurri communities in the area. In their separate speeches, the President General of Ozalla Development Union (ODU) and Chairman, Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Enugu Branch, Barr. CNN Nwagbara, Mrs. Patience Ngene, Hon. Chief Dons Udeh, Hon. Barr Umeadi Nkwonta, among others, dismissed the presence of opposition parties in the area, even as they observed that one of their sons was contesting for governorship in a minor party.  They, however, dismissed his ambition as inconsequential and would not affect the massive votes that the PDP will garner in the area.  Lending his voice, Hon. Dan Nwomeh, a former Chief Press Secretary in the state said the development centre had benefited immensely from the PDP, maintaining that they’re comfortable with the party.  He noted that Ozalla and Obe are strategically positioned to tap from the economic and development potentials outlined  by the governorship candidate in his comprehensive manifesto and statement of purpose to Ndi Enugu.  Stressing that the proposed flyover was not meant for Ozalla community but would benefit motorists across the state, the South East region and the nation at large, Nwomeh pointed  out that it would enhance mobility and the ease of doing business in the area and beyond.  He observed that people from the development center had been appointed as Federal Minister, National Commissioners, State Commissioners, Special Advisers, Permanent Secretaries and other key appointments under the PDP, adding that they would not abandon the party that has done so much for them.
