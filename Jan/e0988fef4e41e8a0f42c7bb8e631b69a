Wike, who spoke in Ibadan yesterday at the official campaign flag-off of Governor ‘Seyi Makinde, held at the ancient Mapo in Ibadan, urged people of the state to cast their votes for all contestants vying for various seats in the 2023 general elections on the platform of the party. He described Governor Makinde as a person who believes in fearness, equity and justice and has done well to deserve  a second term in office. Wike said: “Governor ‘Seyi Makinde has done well, the only way is for him to go back to complete the good work he has started.” “Vote for Governor ‘Seyi Makinde, vote for all the candidates on the platform of the party, but the other one, Seyi Makinde will tell you.” “We believe in justice, fairness, honesty and equity, hence our reason for urging you to support the just governor  God has given you in Oyo State. Makinde has done well since 2019 and the only way we appreciate him is to return him to  government to enable him complete the good works he had started.” In a similar vein, other members of the G5 in their separate remarks at the programme, thanked members of the party for their unflinching support for Governor Makinde,  describing him as a vibrant leader who has what it takes to move the state to enviable heights. In his remark, Abia State governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu,  described Makinde as the youth leader of the G5, saying what the people of the state will see in the next four years will be greater than  what the governor has done in his first four years. While speaking, Governor ‘Seyi Makinde, urged people of the state to vote him for a second term to enable him  complete the good projects he had  started since 2019. According to him, since his assumption of office in 2019, his  administration has continued to deliver dividends of democracy to the people both in health, education, agriculture, security and in infrastructural development. He said: “Under Omotitun 1.0, we promised Emmanuel Alayande University and we delivered, we secured full ownership of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, (LAUTECH) Ogbomoso, we carried out rehabilitation and reconstruction of roads across the state, we have delivered but we are not stopping.” “Under Omotitun 1.0, we improved the standard of education, health, security through the introduction of Amotekun, as well as agricultural development and many others. Workers salaries and pension arrears are being paid  as and when due, and  many others.” “Now it is time for Omotitun 2.0 to upgrade. I am,  therefore, seeking your support for my re-election  to enable me complete the good projects I started in 2019,” Makinde pleaded with people of the state. He then expressed appreciation to the people and party faithful for entrusting the destiny of the state under his care, assuring that more developmental projects and programmes will be witnessed in the state. Makinde, who boasted of jerking up the state’s Internally Generated Revenue of the state from about N1.7 billion to N3.8 billion as of November ending, 2022, among other achievements, promised to do more for the people of the state.
