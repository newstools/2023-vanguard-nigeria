Lassa fever is an animal-borne,  acute viral illness spread by the common African rat (Mastomys). It is endemic in parts of West Africa including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria. About 100,000 to 300,000 infections of Lassa fever occur annually, with about 5,000 deaths. Ribavirin, an antiviral drug, has been used with success in Lassa fever patients. It has been shown to be most effective when given early in the course of the illness. According to NCDC, a suspected case is any individual presenting with one or more of  malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss and either a historyofcontact with excreta or urine of rodents , or contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms or any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhagia. The Agency stated that a confirmed case is any suspected case with laboratory confirmation, while a probable case is any suspected case who died or absconded without collection of specimen for laboratory testing. The primary transmission of the Lassa virus from its host to humans can be prevented by avoiding contact with the vector.   Lassa fever: No health worker infected in reporting week 52 – NCDC In "News" By Sola Ogundipe Nigeria has registered an increase in the number of Lassa fever cases since the beginning of 2020, with 365 positive cases and 47 deaths reported from 23 states across the country.
