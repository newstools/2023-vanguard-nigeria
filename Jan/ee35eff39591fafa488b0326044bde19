China recorded (1.75, 1.12, and 1.23) in April, May, and June. A higher index was also recorded for India (5.17, 3.34, and 2.76 for April, May, and June 2021) and Netherlands (1.60 and 1.36) in May and June but 0.86 in April.

Reacting to the above, the Chief Executive Officer of Multimix Academy, an export-oriented academy, Obiora Madu, decried the fact that most of the items exported are agro-based with no added value. Madu explained that the increase in the volume of export may not be unconnected to the fact that businesses were at the lowest as a result of Covid, stressing that comparison of the increase for this year should be with 2019. He said: “Yes last year it went down, so if I want to compare, I should be looking at 2019 to do the comparison because last year, there was nothing happening more or less so it is not strange if the figure of this year is higher than last year. Most of the export products are agro-based and raw, no value addition which is not the best,” he noted.
