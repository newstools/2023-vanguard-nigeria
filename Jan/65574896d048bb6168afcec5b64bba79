Tinubu spoke during the APC presidential campaign at the MKO Abiola International Stadium, Kuto, Abeokuta. Tinubu declared that the fuel crisis and the scarcity of the newly redesigned Naira notes were artificially created to discourage Nigerians from voting for the APC. The APC presidential candidate called on the people to remain resolute and resist any attempt by anyone to stop the election from holding. Tinubu promised that his administration would also introduce a student loan programme that would ensure that no Nigerian student is unable to complete his or her education because of school fees. “There will be a student loan, nobody will drop out of university because of school fees, I guarantee you that.

Is that not so? “And if you want to eat palm kernel, you would bring stone and use it to break it, then the kernel will come out. “Let them increase the price of fuel, only they know where they have hoarded the fuel. “They hoarded money, they hoarded naira; we will go and vote and we will win. Even if they changed the ink on Naira notes, whatever their plans, it will come to naught. “We are going to win. Those in the PDP will lose (won ma lule),” he declared. He noted that as a homeboy, he had come to Ogun not to put the people to shame, but to win and take over the government.  “I am a homeboy, I have come here, you will not be put to shame, we will take over the government from them, the traitors who wanted to contest with us, they had no experience”, Tinubu said. “This election is a revolution.
