Nigerian singer, Joeboy says it is useless to ask a lover for their body count. The singer expressed his opinion on his Twitter page on saying, claiming it’s unnecessary to ask such questions. According to the singer, due to the fact that it is impossible to know whether the person’s response is sincere, it will be better not to ask. Body count is the total number of partners a person has slept with. At least in Africa, it is typical for couples to inquire about one another’s body count.
