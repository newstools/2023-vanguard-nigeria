By Biodun Busari Hundreds of Amazon workers in the United Kingdom’s warehouse staged a walkout in the first-ever strike to reject 50 pence pay rise on Wednesday. Members of the GMB union who work at the company’s fulfilment centre in Coventry held industrial action as they demanded a wage increase amid big rises in the cost of living, according to Daily Mail. The union workers voted in December after they claimed to have been offered a “pathetic” 50p-an-hour rise from the firm which made £204m in profits in 2021.
