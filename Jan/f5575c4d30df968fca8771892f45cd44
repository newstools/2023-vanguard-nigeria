But whether they are in court or not,my position is that Chief Ikechi Emenike has gotten the governorship flag of our party and will be supported to win the election. “Dr. Uche Ogah is my friend and a member of our party. Please stop all court actions and come and see me. Let’s discuss this matter in our living room. We are the politicians. We put the parties together to salvage Nigeria from hunger, destitution and ignorance. Why are you taking me to third parties who are politically neutral? Please, let’s talk this matter over.” Tinubu pledged to end the era of industrial actions in the nation’s universities and assured that students will no longer spend extra years for courses of four years duration.
