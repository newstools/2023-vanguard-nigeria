I pray God to grant them all the fortitude and grace to bear his cosmic exit. ” I still have very fond memories of Prof. Theophilus Ogunlesi, whose various medical literatures and texts were unputdownable medical bibles that provided insights and solutions to various challenging medical conditions. “Aside from being the very first Nigerian Professor of Medicine and the first President of the National Postgraduate Medical College of Nigeria, and the founding Director of the Ibarapa Community Health Programme, Prof.T.Ogunlesi was a charismatic medical elder, profound scholar, medical pathfinder, and a quintessential leader and administrator.” Calling on the Federal Government of Nigeria and the Ogun State Government to  immortalise him, he said: “Undoubtedly, Nigeria, the medical profession and health community, have lost a colossus who inspired many up and coming medical professionals with his life of commitment to patient care,  medical ethics, equity and justice. May his inimitable and great soul rest in perfect peace  Amosun mourns passing of Ogunlesi, Nigeria's first Professor of Medicine In "News" Nigerian-born Adebayo Ogunlesi, who is the chairman of Global Infrastructure Partners, a private equity firm and one of Fortune 500 companies, has been named a member of an economic advisory forum to US president-elect Donald Trump.
