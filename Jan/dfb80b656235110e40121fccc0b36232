According to the petition, ” the murder of Ebuka was a result of the carrying out of the decision of the meeting of some leaders and members of Aguma village, Umuoji who allegedly conspired among themselves to commit the murder”. Insisting that after they had concluded arrangements to eliminate Ebuka, the suspects took further steps to acquire firearms with which they executed the crime they conceived, adding that themselves, as Ebuka’s bereaved family members are deeply concerned about the attitude of officers and men of Ogidi Police Division who delayed in arresting the majority of the key suspects in the murder case. Also insisting that the acts they complained of against the suspects constitute grave breaches of criminal law which attracts maximum punishment and ought to be treated with the seriousness it deserves, the petitioners therefore urged the CP to direct a discrete investigation of their complaint with a view to bringing whoever is implicated in any way in the murder, to justice.
