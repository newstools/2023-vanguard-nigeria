Father Sati Edward said that ” the fire which started  at noon on the fateful day, razed  the fully equipped Science Laboratory, two blocks of hostels, a 500-hundred capacity student dinning hall with a kitchen attached worth over 100million Naira.” Speaking to journalists after inspecting the razed Seminary, Rev.Sati explained that “I got a call around 12 noon on that day, that the hostel was on fire, I immediately called the Archbishop of Kaduna and by the time I came back from town the youths in Katari town were here and making effort to put off the fire. We noticed fire at the toilet,  while we were trying to put it off at that time, the Archbishop who drove in by that time noticed  the fire at the laboratory and before we moved there the fire was all over the laboratory building.” “So when the fire started the security men raised alarm before the youths ran in to assist us in putting off the fire, the damage was already done but we commended the gallantry of the youths who assisted in putting of the fire.” “We need the help of good  citizens, people who care about Nigeria of tomorrow, so that we can restructure the area,” he said. The Ditector, Social Communication of the Archdiocese, Rev. Father Stephen Onyema said, “we thank God no life was lost,  but we have lost alot and we are calling on all well meaning citizens to help out. We are praying to get funds to restructure the whole place. We may need to raise new structures completely since these ones have been badly damaged by fire”. The Education Secretary of the  Archdiocese, Sir John Woje  Bagu said the incident was a  traumatic one and called on well meaning Nigerians to support the Archdiocese with funds so as to rebuild the seminary.   All Hallows Seminary, Onitsha, shines as Team Anambra wins National Interschool Presidential Debate In "News" It was a very painful and teary event at the Saints Simon and Jude Seminary Kuje, when late Rev.
