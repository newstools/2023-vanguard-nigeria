Hon Sheriff Oborevwori, would not engage his All Progressives Congress, APC, counterpart,  Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, in a kangaroo and stage-managed debate. Omo-Agege,  Deputy Senate President, recently, challenged Oborevwori, Speaker of the state House of Assembly, to a debate. However, the Assistant Deputy Director, Media and Publicity of the PDP Campaign Organization in the state, Mr. Fred Oghenesivbe, in a statement, said: “PDP governorship candidate, Oborevwori, is too busy explaining his robust manifesto and,  therefore,  will not engage the rejected governorship candidate of APC in any form of debate.” “As a matter of fact, it will be a political sacrilege for our highly respected excessive local content governorship candidate of the PDP to stand on the same podium with Senator Augustine Ovie Omo-Agege to debate or speak on any issue. “Oborevwori will continue to focus on regular interface with Deltans in the state to explain his M.O.R.E agenda to the people, not to participate in any kangaroo, stage-managed debate. “It is obvious that Agege is trying to cover his poorly attended campaigns by calling for manipulated debates.

He shall remain focused on engaging the People and explaining his M.O.R.E agenda, not any debate instigated and bankrolled by an unscrupulous mace runner alleged to be the most corrupt SSG since the creation of Delta state,” he said.  Deputy Senate President and Delta All Progressives Congress, APC, Governorship candidate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, has challenged the People's Democratic Party, PDP, governorship candidate and Speaker of Delta State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon Sheriff Oborevwori, to a public debate on their stewardship to the Urhobo people of Delta Central. In "News" ASABA—Executive Assistant to Delta State Governor on Communications, Olorogun Fred Oghenesivbe, has said that the just concluded gubernatorial primary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the state was a show of shame, and it clearly revealed the overbearing nature of the APC candidate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege.
