We are not afraid of an investigation, because he’s the most investigated Nigerian and if you investigate him again he will come out clean,” he added. The PDP spokesperson, however, insisted that the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is the person, who is expected to be investigated and prosecuted. “He is the one that has been indicted already in a certified court indictment. He is the man that has faced the Code of Conduct before,” he said.
