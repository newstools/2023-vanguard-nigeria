We are indeed alarmed and particulardismayedbyn by the probable recession of sponsored terrorism and brazen act of war against opposing voices in the State and wish to condemn without any reservations such an act which has unfortunately become a serious threat to our democracy. “However, we are appalled by the continued declaration of hostilities and unleashing of terror on the opposition Candidates in the State which has indeed assumed an alarming and unfortunate progression.
