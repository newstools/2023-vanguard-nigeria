Raheem, who was pregnant, was fatally shot on Dec. 25 by a police officer attached to the Ajiwe police division in the Ajah area of the state. The family of Raheem, a Lagos-based lawyer, and Gbenga, the husband, have been receiving guests since the unfortunate incident. Osinbajo contacted the husband and family on Dec. 28 to condole and pray with them, even though aides say he has been away on vacation since Christmas Day when he preached at the Aso Villa Chapel. The murder of the late Raheem on Christmas day has sparked reactions from Nigerians from different walks of life, including condolences for the family and prayers for the repose of her soul. The vice president, during the phone call made from his vacation, also assured the deceased family of justice and prayed God to give them the fortitude to bear the loss. The late Raheem was a member of the Olive Parish of the RCCG in Ikoyi, where Osinbajo was a Pastor up until 2015 when he took office as Vice President. Alongside President Muhammadu Buhari, Osinbajo, had in the wake of the EndSARs protest in 2020, championed the reform of the police special units, eventually leading to the outright dissolution of the police anti-robbery squad. Moreso, the vice president, while acting as president, had directed an overhauling of Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in line with his pro-rule of law stance, disdain for extrajudicial killing and his outright condemnation of police brutality. Osinbajo, had also, through the National Economic Council (NEC), directed the creation of judicial panels in states across the country that reviewed cases of police brutality and extra-judicial killings across the country in the ENDSARS aftermath. Arising from those panels hundreds of millions have been paid as damages and compensations, even as the administration is expected to do more. Aside the vice president, other prominent Nigerians including Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, have also condemned the killing and commiserated with the Raheem family.
