The people of Oruk Anam are my political backbone and this dates back to 2006 when I was aspiring for the governorship of our dear state. You people supported me to defeat over 56 other aspirants at the primaries. ” You also stood by me to win the governorship election in 2006 and re-elected me in 2011. As governor, I laid a solid foundation for the future development of our senatorial District and the state in general. ” My uncommon performance in office as your governor was to lay the foundation for the emergence of another governor within us in the future because as they say, one good turn deserves another. “Before I left office in 2015, I was able to link Abak, Etim Ekpo and Ika local government areas to other parts of the state through a good road network. It was also through your support that I was elected into the National Assembly. “It is in appreciation of that support that I decided to flag off my ward tour in Oruk Anam in order to personally say thank you to all of you for all the support.
