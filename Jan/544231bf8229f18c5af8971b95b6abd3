He said the young people are most affected in the years of bad governance that has held the country by its jugular, which he said is directly linked to why most youths seek the greener pasture overseas.  He  said that the only way they can have a say in the governance process is by deploying their large numbers to cause a positive change, adding that to cause a paradigm shift the youth must go and collecting their permanent voter card, PVC and participate across board to decide who will preside over the affairs of Nigeria.  He said, “It’s no longer enough to lament and complain endlessly over the state of our country. The upcoming elections present us with an opportunity to recruit those we want at the helm of affairs, those we believe will protect our interest, those we believe are qualified and have the credibility and integrity to pilot our affairs.  “The poor infrastructure in the country is killing businesses and thwarting dreams. Some of our young people are nursing one entrepreneurial dream or the other but the environment has not encouraged them. That also directly or indirectly affects the economy and plays a major role in the burgeoning unemployment rate in our country.  “A visionary leadership will roll out policies and initiatives that will encourage small scale businesses and help entrepreneurship to thrive. That is the kind of candidate Nigeria youths should vote for as they go out to cast their ballot”, Dr. Abuyere said.  He also encouraged them to shun thuggery and brigandage even as he says selling their votes is a recipe for slavery and subjugation.  As 2023 general elections draws near in Nigeria, the Kebbi state Chairman of National youths Caucus of Nigeria (NYCN) Alhaji Sanusi Bala Dan inno has charged youths in Kebbi and the nation at large to embrace self discipline and high moral standards during and after the polls.
