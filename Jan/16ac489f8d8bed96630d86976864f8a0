By Biodun Busari  An Ugandan court had ordered a woman to pay back a total of 9.4 million shillings ($2,550; £2,060) to her ex-fiancé for failing to marry him after four years of marital relationship.  Magistrate Asanasio Mukobi of the court in Kanungu gave the verdict on Thursday saying the woman, Fortunate Kyarikunda broke her promise to Richard Tumwine.
