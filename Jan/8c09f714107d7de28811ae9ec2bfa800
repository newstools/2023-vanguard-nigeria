His words,”Diphtheria, a vaccine preventable disease that used to be common decades ago is on the increase in some states in Nigeria. The fact that there is a resurgence suggests that there is significant reduction in vaccination coverage among pockets of the population and this reduced pockets of immunity has given rise to the cases we have seen. “It is not a matter of diphtheria spreading from state to state, the bacteria that causes the disease is present everywhere and it spreads, and any state in which you find the disease now is likely to be associated with suboptimal vaccination rates, either in general or in particular in pockets of population. Failure of childhood vaccination in the failed states causing the diphtheria outbreaks. “Kano has highest number of cases followed by Yobe, by weekend, there were 34 deaths in total.”  He warned that although diphtheria was highly preventable and treatable,  fatality can increase without antibiotics and appropriate conditions, including the diphtheria antitoxin. He assured that with early detection and prompt treatment, the fatal outcomes are usually low. Adetifa stressed that the really severe cases require the diphtheria antitoxin, even as he assured that the NCDC had distributed  vials of the antitoxin since December for use in Lagos and Kano states, and was planning to extend availability to every state where the disease cases are found. “It is important that patients should be recognised early, and laboratory confirmation carried out so that treatment can commence immediately.” Adetifa said there were arrangements for trainings of personnel for laboratory diagnosis of the toxin including testing for most of the clinical effects.  “We are in a good state to help, but patients need to be recognised early and diagnosis made quickly and they are placed on the right treatment. “We are using the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency,  NPHCDA data to predict high risk states, there is connection with low socioeconomic situation, and we need to look out for healthcare workers who can be given courses of antibiotics.   The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, yesterday announced a decline in the outbreak of meningitis in the most affected states, even as the death toll has reached a total of 1,069 from 13,420 suspected cases as at May 9, 2017.
