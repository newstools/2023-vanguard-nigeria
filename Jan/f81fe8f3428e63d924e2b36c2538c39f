He said the PDP had the best candidates in the elections given their track record of achievements and urged the people of Bayelsa West to vote for the party to continue enjoying effective representation.  Diri also appealed to people of the state to vote for the PDP’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, to right the wrongs of the current All Progressives Congress, APC’s government. He said: “You have always supported us and we know you will do the same again. For the upcoming elections, we trust that you will deliver the PDP as you have always done. We have the best candidates.” Also, the Deputy Governor, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, lauded the campaign council for mobilising members of the party for the flag-off event despite the short notice. He said the PDP was poised to win the elections in the state and assured the people of Bayelsa West that the party will not let them down.
