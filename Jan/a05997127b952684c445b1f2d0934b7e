In a statement by the group’s North-Central Coordinator, Aliyu Musa Pass, the group said “Tinubu’s ‘Abeokuta declaration  compelled the Federal Government to extend the deadline to 10th February and saved the nation from going up in flames, as consequence of the raging public anger that pervaded the atmosphere before the sudden 10 days extension.” The group attributed the sudden 10 days extension of the Naira swap to “Tinubu’s sagacity and courage.It was this courage and purposeful leadership shown by the Asiwaju that compelled the government to go back on its earlier “no going back stance”. “Nigerians certainly owe Tinubu immense gratitude for stepping in and risking everything to change the obviously bad situation  occasioned by the initial January 31st deadline.”  “Whether anyone wants to believe it or not, it is the courageous sagacity displayed by Tinubu that invariably saved the Nigerian commoner from suffering the pains of the initial timeline set by the Federal Government for the unpopular new currency swap. “And by that singular action, Tinubu also saved the nation from going up in flames as consequence of the raging public anger that pervaded the atmosphere before the sudden 10 days extension.” “Tinubu, proving himself a great statesman,  in his now famous Abeokuta declaration, took the bold and necessary step of alerting on the dangers inherent in the new naira policy, its timing and deadline.” “Apparently rattled the President invited Asiwaju to Daura where the man stood his ground insisting the policy was unnecessary, unpopular and would only harm the common man and lead to greater conflict.” “The nation certainly owe Tinubu immense gratitude for stepping in and risking everything to save an obvious bad situation,” they said.   The Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Waziri Atiku Abubakar, has raised the alarm over an alleged plot by his opponents in the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu, to cause riots with the aim of causing a revolution.
