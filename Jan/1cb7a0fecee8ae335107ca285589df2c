We will check the gully erosion devastating the state. “I will turn Anambra into an industrial revolution state. We will train our youths so that they can secure well-paying jobs and be useful to themselves. “I started paying WAEC fees for every student in Lagos, whether you are Igbo or Yoruba or Hausa and I will be fair to all Nigerians if I become president.” He promised to work with the Anambra State governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo, who he described as a very brilliant man if he is elected president of Nigeria, recalling that he also discovered another Anambra son, Mr Ben Akabueze who worked with him in Lagos and is presently the presidential adviser on budget. He urged the Nigerian electorate not to listen to those he described as lying politicians. He added: “How long will it take them to lie from Port Harcourt to Onitsha; Onitsha to Aba. “For 16 years, PDP lied to the nation that they will industrialize Nigeria, but they industrialized their pockets. “One person said he is the candidate of the north and I urge voters not to listen to him.
