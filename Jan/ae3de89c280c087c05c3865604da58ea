The more than 100 member-council was inaugurated by the governorship candidate of the party in the state, Dr. Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odii, who also is the Chairman of the Council. Odii explained that the task before the members of the GCC was to work towards a resounding victory for the Party at all levels. He gave the council a marching order to develop a calendar for the campaign rallies in the state within 24 hours. According to him, if elected his administration would be committed to the provision of credible leadership; creation of wealth and restoration of economic prosperity for the people of the State. According to him, “We are here for serious business, we are not joking until the day we are declared as the winners of all the elections in Ebonyi; this is why we have carefully selected you for this campaign council. “Under our watch, Ebonyi will move tremendously towards being one of the richest states in the country. “I have said before and let me reiterate it that I will use the natural resources Ebonyi is endowed with to develop the state and we are going to use our arable lands to generate wealth. “I said that when I started my business, I started with zero balance sheet and was able to grow it into a thriving business that now cuts across Africa, and the world and I are ready to deploy that business ingenuity to create wealth for Ebonyi people.” He congratulated members of the council for making the list noting that more members would be injected into the council reminding them that there was work to be done. On the rumoured delisting of all the candidates of the party from the website of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Odii noted that it was the handiwork of the opposition who were afraid of the influence and popularity of the PDP in the state. He added, “The opposition in the mischievous propaganda was trying to confuse the people but the truth remains that the people love us and we remain the candidates for the elections.” Vanguard gathered that Austin Edeze, a governorship aspirant on the platform of PDP, was appointed the Director-General of the GCC while all senatorial and House of Representatives candidates were appointed members of the council. Also, a former Commissoner for Information in Ebonyi State, Chief Abia Onyike, was appointed the Director of Media and Publicity, of the council; while the Publicity Secretary of the party in the state, Comrade Chika Nwoba, was named the council’s Director for New Media. With the constitution of the PDP’s Campaign Council, many are optimistic that the opposition political party stands a better chance to give the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC, a run for their money.   The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Sokoto state has inaugurated its governorship campaign council for the 2023 General Elections.
