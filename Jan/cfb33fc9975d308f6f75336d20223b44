In a tribute to his father-in-law, Dr. Uduaghan described the late army general as his mentor and father who contributed immensely to the growth, development and unity of Nigeria, most especially during the Civil War where he fought against the Biafran militants. While calling on the Federal Government to honour gallant officers who sacrificed their all for the country, the former governor told the audience that Brig-General Tuoyo led the team that cut off supply for the Biafrans which led to their defeat in 1970. According to him: “It’s been tough trying to put down a tribute. My relationship with daddy, Brig-Gen Sunny Tuoyo Rtd started about 35 years ago as father and son-in-law. It gradually grew to become more of a son-and-daddy relationship with less emphasis on the issue of in-law. “He was a nation builder who sacrificed so much to the unity of Nigeria, though hardly heard of. It will amaze you to know that daddy was one those who made the defeat of Biafra possible. “With his experience in the military, especially as an administrator in the old Ondo State, he advised me quite often on several issues that arose during my tenure as commissioner for Health, SSG and governor of Delta State. He contributed so much to restoring peace in the Niger Delta region during the militancy when I was the governor of Delta State. “He had a good heart and many got to me for one favour or the other through him. Sadly, some of these people never acknowledged his role in getting such favours. I will miss him.” On her part, Mrs. Roli Nere Uduaghan, the first daughter of the deceased and former first lady of Delta State said: “I’m super proud of having him as my father. He lived a life worthy of emulation. God will reward him abundantly for all his good deeds and forgive him of all his shortcomings. He would always call to pray for me and to bless me with all his heart. He was loved so dearly, and brought so much happiness to the many hearts he touched. “He was always kind, caring and understanding towards people. He is a blessing and God’s gift to everyone who came across him and brought so much joy to many. He will be greatly missed.” The late Brig-General Tuoyo was born on 24th February 1935 in Sapele, Delta State. He was enlisted into the Nigerian Army in 1962 as a platoon commander, from there grew to the rank of a brigadier-general where he retired. He is survived by his beloved wife, Mrs. Henrietta, six children, nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
