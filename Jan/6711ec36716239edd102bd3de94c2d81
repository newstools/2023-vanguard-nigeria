CUPP, in a statement by its Co-National Spokesperson, Mr Mark Adebayo said: “We are not perturbed because justice will eventually be done on this case. The same way that fuel scarcity is biting hard across the country and motorists have to resort to the black market to buy fuel is the same way that we consider this judgment as a black market purchased judgment that we are confident will eventually be overturned by higher Courts.

The mandate willfully given by the Osun State people to Governor Adeleke remains intact and any attempt to steal it will fail woefully.”   The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr Uche Secondus, has congratulated the party’s Gubernatorial Candidate for Osun, Sen. Ademola Adeleke, for his victory at the election tribunal.
