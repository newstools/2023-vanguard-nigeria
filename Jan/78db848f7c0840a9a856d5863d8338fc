TCN’s General Manager, Public Affairs, Ndidi Mbah in a statement in Abuja, said a simulation carried out on transmission capacity showed that it continued to outstrip available power generation capability. Mbah pointed out that TCN has continued to expand the nation’s grid, by rehabilitating and upgrading brown field/existing projects and building new/green field projects. She noted that TCN wheeling capacity has increased from about 5000MW in 2016 to 8100MW and growing, through the diligent implementation of the Nigerian Electricity Grid Maintenance Expansion & Rehabilitation Programme, NEGMERP. “The projects are in various TCN old or new Substations nationwide, from the North to the South, to the East and West. The projects, substations, lines and systems operations projects are numerous and on ground nationwide. Several are already in circuit while others are ongoing. “TCN’s capacity and capability to transport bulk power is presently above the current bulk power generated into the grid and quantum power being taken by the DisCos. “On March 1st, 2021, the GenCos generated a record peak of 5,801MW which was equally transmitted very successfully to distribution load centres nationwide, eligible customers, and international customers,” Mbah noted. In a related development, the Transmission Company of Nigeria has disclosed that it has taken delivery of two number brand new 150 MVA, 330/132/33kV power transformers and accessories at its Central Store Ojo, Lagos State. TCN said another two 150MVA power transformers were awaiting delivery to Ojo Stores at the Lagos Port even as it is expecting the arrival of different capacities of transformers and their accessories to berth at the port very soon.  By Udeme Akpan THE Transmission Company of Nigeria, TCN, has concluded plans to increase Nigeria’s wheeling capacity from 8, 000 to 20,000 megawatts by 2022. In a recent report obtained by Vanguard, TCN said development object of its transmission rehabilitation and expansion program (TREP) is to rehabilitate, stabilize and provide… In "Business" The Transmission Company of Nigeria, TCN, has disclosed its plan to increase the wheeling capacity of the national grid from 7000 megawatts to 9000mw before the end of 2018. In "News" ABUJA—THE Transmission Company of Nigeria, TCN, has vowed to avert future system collapse in the power sector with adequate measures put in place to enhance improved service delivery to electricity distribution companies and consumers in the country.
