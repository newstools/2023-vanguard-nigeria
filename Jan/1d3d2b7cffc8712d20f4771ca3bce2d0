When my friend comes to spend time with me, I pay for everything. Recently, I went to her place and she treated me shabbily. She barely cooked, and begrudged me a second piece of meat. One evening, she refused to let me have a bath because she claimed she bought water all the time. Read Also: Dear Bunmi, is he controlling me through sex?  She even complained about the foodstuffs I used. Now she’s asking when she can come to visit me again. What can I say? Itunnu, by e-mail. Dear Itunnu,      If you’re inclined to give this woman a second chance, I suggest you get the ground rules established before she arrives. Outline what you’re prepared to do and pay for, and insist on a sort of kitty for any extras.  If she’s not happy with that, she can stay away. Personally, I wouldn’t have anything more to do with someone who denied me basic sustenance and courtesy. Share your problems and release your burden.
