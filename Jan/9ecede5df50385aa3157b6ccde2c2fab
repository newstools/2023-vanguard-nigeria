So it’s dangerous to underestimate Russia.” Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, as Putin said his country sought the “demilitarisation and denazification” of Ukraine. Putin has threatened to use nuclear weapons which could jeopardise the peace and safety of the world if the West aids Ukraine in the war. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) verified a total of 6,919 civilian deaths since the war began.  NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg on Monday demanded Russia end its naval standoff with Ukraine, but refused to pledge new support for Kiev, as the alliance sought to avoid escalating the crisis.
