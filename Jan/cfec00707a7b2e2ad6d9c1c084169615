With your vote, you will expunge them. “I promised to restore peace and security in Nigeria I have done it in the past I, so, see no reason why with your support and backing by the grace of God there wont be peace in Nigeria. “Secondly the people of Zamfara are known for trading, farming, rearing today none of these exists, therefore with your support we will restore all businesses, ensure that all our youth are schooling without hitches. “When you elect your governor we will collaborate with him to ensure that all things Zamfara needed is done.““As Federal government we will ensure the construction of railway that brought wealth to Kaura.
