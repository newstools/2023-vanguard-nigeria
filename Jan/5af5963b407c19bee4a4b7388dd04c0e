Despite the large turn-out, officials of the commission who were on ground to attend to the crowd also ensured that the process went orderly without incidents. Speaking on the development, the Public Affairs Officer of the Commission in Benue state, Mr. Terkaa Andyer noted that the large turn-out of young adults and youths to collect their PVCs was encouraging and a clear indication that Nigerians want to exercise their franchise in the coming elections.
