Shaibu said, “This desperation was brought to the fore in 2011 when Tinubu removed the rug from under Nuhu Ribadu of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) and made a deal with the Federal Government to ensure that President Goodluck Jonathan wins. “This time round, Atiku’s aide said:  “Apparently miffed by the reactions that have trailed his ignoble meeting with the G-5 Governors, Tinubu, told a barefaced lie by denying ever meeting the governors in London. “Incidentally, Governor Nyesom Wike, who is known for his bravado, had failed to deny ever meeting with Tinubu, saying instead that “They said we had a meeting with so and so.
