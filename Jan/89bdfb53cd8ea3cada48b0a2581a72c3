We request the state government to give all the political parties a level playing ground, to exercise their franchise. “That our Ohaukwu brothers should remember that we supported Dr Sam Egwu during his governorship and Senatorial ambition, which led to his victory for the two consecutive term respectively. “We remind our brothers from the Ebonyi Central Senatorial Zone, to give us their support as we supported their brother – Chief Martins Nwanchor Elechi so as to produce the next Governor of this state come 2023 general elections. “We equally remind our brothers from the Ebonyi South Senatorial Zone to remember that Izzi Nnodo Youth Forum first declared to shift power to go to the Southern zone of the state at the Teachers’ Training College, Igneagu in Izzi Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, and this later led to the emergence of Governor David Nweze Umahi in 2015 till date. “That we assure all and sundry, that we have resolved and will ensure Izzi clan extraction to have a consensus candidate in the person of Architect Dr Edward Nkwegu, before the voting day. “  The All Progressive Congress, APC, Governorship candidate for the 2023 general election and Speaker of Ebonyi State House of Assembly, Rt.
