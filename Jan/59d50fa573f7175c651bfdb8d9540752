Comrade Chinedu Ogah, (OON), yesterday threatened to institute a legal action against the West African Examination Council, WAEC, over the seizure of some results belonging to Ebonyi indigenes in the country. The House of Representatives member who was displeased by the development called on the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, to sanction WAEC over what it describes as the Council’s derailment from it’s administrative mandate. Disclosing this in a statement, Ogah wondered why students of Ebonyi State origin would be made to pass through such difficult situation after registering and sitting for WAEC examination with their counterpart from other States of the Federation. He added that if the development was not given the attention it requires, it could lead to youth restiveness and proliferation of other social vices among youths in the State. According to him, “I want to call on the West African Examination Council, WAEC, to immediately release the remaining part of the results belonging to indigenes of Ebonyi State. The statement read in part: “I urge WAEC to reverse the N500, 000 sanction placed on the affected schools as there are not evidence supporting the fact that there was any form of malpractice carried out by the schools. “During the conduct of such examination, WAEC has examination supervisors, invigilators and general supervisors who oversee the examination. These categories of individuals never cancel the examination when it took place. “What is the rationale of releasing part of the WAEC results and withholding part? We want the part being withheld by WAEC to be released as those remaining are critical subjects. “I have consulted my lawyers to institute legal action against WAEC if it refuses to rescind its decision. “We want to call on the Minister of Education to call on WAEC to provide the Federal Government with evidence of payment of Education tax and how it has applied the Federal character policy in its administrative activities. “WAEC is supposed to show evidence of taxes paid to the Federal Government as they usually make billions of naira annually in the conduct of various examinations. “I call on the Minister of Education to sanction WAEC for failure to operate within the perimeters of its mandate.”  The Member representing Ikwo/Ezza South Federal Constituency at the National Assembly, Hon. Comrade Chinedu Ogah (OON) Monday threatened to sue the West African Examination Council, WAEC, over the seizure of the results belonging to the indigenes of Ebonyi State.
