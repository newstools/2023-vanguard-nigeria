Ovie Omo-Agege, the APC governorship candidate in Delta, has said that the era of politics of intimidation and violence was over with the introduction of BVAS machines in the nation’s electoral system. Omo-Agege, who is also the Deputy President of the Senate, made the remark on Saturday during the party’s ward-to-ward campaign in Uzere, Aviara and Olomoro communities in Isoko South Local Government Area of the state. The lawmaker representing Delta Central Senatorial District said that the party would resist any attempt by leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to intimidate the APC members in Isokoland and other parts of the state. “The politics of intimidation is over. With the introduction of the BVAS machine by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), be rest assured that we buried the politics of intimidation and violence.  “Let me assure our teeming supporters that there will be adequate security in the next elections. For our supporters and Isoko people who want to vote for APC, come on the days of the elections and vote for us. “For those planning to intimidate our members, they should know that we will resist them,” Omo-Agege warned. He urged the electorate in Isoko and other parts of the state to turn out en mass to vote for all APC candidates in the Presidential, National Assembly, Governorship and State Assembly elections, assuring that there would be adequate security. The lawmaker further assured the people of Delta that their votes would count in the forthcoming elections, adding that the era when election materials were snatched and thumb-printed in political leaders’ homes was gone forever.  At Aviara Kingdom, Omo-Agege told the cheering crowd that his administration resolved and restored the aged-long electrical blackout in the community.

Other defectors from the PDP included Mr Goodluck Obrogo and  Mr James Miller, a political aide to the majority leader of the Delta House of Assembly.
