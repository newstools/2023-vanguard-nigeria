When PDP was in power from 1999 to 2015 was there inaecurity in Niger? “We want to assure you that if you return PDP we will eliminate insecurity in Niger. We also assure you that the Baro port that the PDP first constructed before you demanded for change, now have you seen the change? “What did the change brought? Insecurity, hardship and economic meltdown. We appeal to you to return PDP for improved security, development and other things in Niger and the country at large. “I want to remind the people of Niger, most of the schools, universities, roads and hospitals, let’s assume you voted for APC.

Niger state has beautiful land, Niger state has a lot of water resources, Niger state has energy and that is why you are called the power centre of Nigeria. “Niger state, unknown to so many people, has the highest concentration of mineral resources ranging from gold to every other thing possible under the ground. “But unfortunately, under the APC, Niger state is almost the headquarter of poverty. It is also the headquarters of insecurity. “At some point, 10 of the local government in Niger state were occupied by bandits, yet we have a government that promised that it will give you change, it will give you security, it will give you development. I just want to tell my good people of Niger state that it is time to come back home. “ Also, the Vice Presidential candidate of the party, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, accused the ruling APC of taking the state and the nation backwards many years. He said, “In the last eight years, the APC government has done a great damage to Nigeria. They brought poverty to us, they brought insecurity to us, they have divided Nigeria and that is not what we want as a people. “PDP has brought a father, a man who is humble, a man who is ready to care for you, a man who is ready to love all Nigerians, a man who does not care whether you are a Muslim or a Christian, he is ready to attend to your needs and that is Atiku Abubakar. “We are very convinced that he is able to unit Nigeria again.
