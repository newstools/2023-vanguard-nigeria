The development forced most vehicle owners to park them, thus slowing down movement in the state.

For instance, a journey from Onitsha to Awka, which used to be N500, was increased to N1000, while intra city transport increased from N100 to N300 in the major cities of Awka, Onitsha and Nnewi. A civil servant, Mr. Okechukwu Onuma said he had decided to suspend his planned journey to his village as he could no longer afford the cost of fueling his car. “It was a difficult decision to take, but I had to take it because there are bills to pay this month, including school fees and house rent. ” In fact, the hike in fuel prize was a blessing in disguise for me because I could have spent so much money in the village,” he said.
