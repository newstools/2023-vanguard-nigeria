By Babajide Komolafe, Economy Editor  Comercio Partners Limited, an investment banking firm,    has counselled investors to focus attention on industries positioned to profit from the    current macroeconomic trends as revealed in the Gross Domestic Product, GDP report for 2022. Tosin Osunkoya, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer,    Comercio Partners Asset Management Limited, gave this advice while reviewing the GDP report for the fourth quarter of last year, Q4’22, released recently by the National Bureau of Statistics, NBS.    Among other things, the NBS report showed that while the economy recorded GDP growth of 3.52 per cent, Year-on-Year, YoY, in Q4’22, up from 2.25 per cent in Q3’22, it however recorded a lower annual GDP growth of 3.1 per cent, YoY for Full Year 2022, FY’22, down from 3.4 per cent in FY’21. Osunkoya noted though the economy recorded lower GDP growth in FY’22 due to the combined effect of the high inflation levels triggered by the Russia war in Ukraine as well as the    19.22 per cent    contraction in the oil sector, the performance of the Services sector which continued in to improve in 2022 represents a major silver lining. He added that the impact of the improved performance of    the Services sector is reflected in the higher real growth of 4.4 per cent, YoY recorded    in the Non-Oil sector in Q4 ’22.  Speaking on investment opportunities highlighted in the    FY” 22    GDP performance of the economy,    Osukoya stressed that    though there are areas of concerns, namely    the continued contraction in the oil sector and hushed growth in the agricultural sector, investors should focus their attention on specific industries that are strategically positioned to profit from the current macroeconomic condition.  He said: “With the oil sector’s enormous influence on the Nigerian economy, its ongoing decline—which was marked by a negative growth rate of -14.93% in Q4 2022—is a major cause for concern”.
