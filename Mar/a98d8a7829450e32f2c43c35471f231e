By Adeola Badru  A contender to the stool of Aseyin of Iseyin, Prince Sefiu Olawale Oyebola-Adeyeri has commended the Oyo State government and kingmakers in the ancient town for the painstaking and rigorous process applied in the selection of a new monarch. Prince Oyebola-Adeyeri who spoke with Vanguard on phone from his New York base on Friday, urged all contenders to the throne to maintain peace and cordiality while awaiting the outcome of the selection process.  Olawale disclosed that the rigorous process nonetheless, the outcome of the selection would favor the community, as the approach of the kingmakers to introduce transparency procedures like open interviews of contestants would give a sense of belonging to all royal houses involved. He, therefore, urged the people of the community to support the kingmakers with prayer as their decision will have a long-term effect on the town in the areas of human and societal growth. According to him: “We were all living witnesses to the process that produced some of our fore-bearers as Aseyin, it has always been rigorous and rancorous, but with the approach used by the kingmakers this time around, we are sure of a smooth and pleasant experience.”  “Iseyin people at home and abroad should please support the kingmakers with prayer so they may succeed to have a smooth and rancor-free process, I am a contestant to the throne and I am happy they have thrown the process open.”  Prince Oyebola-Adeyeri who has worked with many organisations in Nigeria before relocating to America was born on the April, 6, 1969 to the Oyebola-Adeyeri Royal family and has positively impacted the lives of his people in Iseyin community through various philanthropic efforts.  He promised to use his developmental and leadership skills in management of people and resources to elevate the status of Iseyin among other Yoruba communities.
