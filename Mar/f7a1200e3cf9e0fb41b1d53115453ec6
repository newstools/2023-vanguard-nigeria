Manchester United bounced back from a historic humiliation by Liverpool to beat Real Betis 4-1 in the first leg of their Europa League last 16 tie.  United equalled their heaviest ever defeat and worst since 1931 in losing 7-0 at Anfield on Sunday. Erik ten Hag responded by naming the same starting line-up and was rewarded with a return to form.  Marcus Rashford smashed United into an early lead with his 26th goal of the season, but Betis levelled against the run of play when Ayoze Perez fired into the far corner. The visitors could even have gone in front before half-time when Perez’s deflected cross came back off the post. But it was two of United’s most fiercely criticised stars in recent days who made the difference after the break.  Antony curled a brilliant shot into the top corner before Bruno Fernandes, who Ten Hag named again as captain, headed in Luke Shaw’s corner.  Wout Weghorst then netted just his second goal in 15 appearances for United by pouncing from close range six minutes from time.
