Bayern Munich star, Thomas Muller has taken a dig at Argentine legend Lionel Messi after the Bavarian giants knocked out Paris Saint Germain in the Champions League Round of 16 on Wednesday.  This isn’t the first time the Bayern veteran will troll players, with the most recent aimed at former teammate, Robert Lewandowski prior to Bayern’s clash with Barcelona in the 2022/23 Champions League group stage. He addressed the message via Instagram back in October 2022, sending a message to the Polish star stating “Lewy, We are coming”.  Back to the dig with Messi, the 33-year-old German told reporters that things always go to plan when his team faces the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner unlike against Cristiano Ronaldo. “Against Messi, things always go well at all levels in terms of results,” he said. “At club level, Cristiano Ronaldo was our problem when he was at Real Madrid.  “But I have the greatest respect for Messi’s World Cup performance.  “Messi’s individual performance at the World Cup was amazing.  “He carried the whole squad.  “It’s not so easy to play at a team like PSG. “It’s difficult to get a really good team balance,” he ended.  The last time Muller faced the PSG man, he sided with a Bayern team that thrashed Messi’s Barcelona 8-2 back in 2020.
