Nollywood actress, Iyabo Ojo has backed Labour Party’s governorship candidate, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour ahead of the Lagos governorship election.  In an Instagram post, the actress shared a campaign flyer of the LP candidate while expressing confidence in Rhodes-Vivour’s leadership for a better Lagos. Ojo, in her caption, described Rhodes-Vivour as a “Son of the Soil, Omo Eko Gangan.”  The entrepreneur, however, urged Lagosians to support their own choice and avoid fighting. She wrote: “Son of the soil…Omo Eko gangan….remain blessed and highly favored @grvlagos “Please vote & support your own choice in peace. Let the best man win. A better Lagos is what we pray for, no fight, no hate.”
