Real Madrid attacker Eden Hazard does not have plans on leaving the Spanish giants despite lack of game time at the Santiago Bernabeu.  According to Goal, Hazard is hopeful to see out his contract set to be due in June 2024. It is also reported that the Belgian recently declined a potential move to Major League Soccer.  He has been in discussions about his future with the club for the last month and the final conclusion was that he should stay. The 32-year-old was perceived to be the successor of Cristiano Ronaldo when he joined Real from Chelsea for a club record of about €150 million including add-ons in 2019. When he put the pen to paper, he overshadowed Gareth Bale’s transfer of €101 million to Los Blancos back in 2013.  He has only seen 296 minutes across all competitions for Madrid this season, registering only a goal and an assist.  The Bernabau gaffer, Carlo Ancelotti has made it known that he would be given opportunities to impress before the season comes to a conclusion.  “Hazard is fine. He is training and he wants to have minutes. He can get them in the next few games,” Ancelotti said in a pre-match press conference last week.  His goal contributions this season came from Real Madrid’s 3-0 win over Celtic in the Champions League.
