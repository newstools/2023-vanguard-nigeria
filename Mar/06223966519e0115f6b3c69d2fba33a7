By Afolabi O. Quadri  Ramadān as a holy month in Islam cannot be equated with any other month; carrying the heavyweight prescription of Allah for the entire Muslim Ummah to fast. This fasting has been prescribed for communities before that of Prophet Muhammad, though with notable differences. Fasting is essentially for the sake of boosting the piety of Muslims. Allah says thus “O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous” Quran 2: 183. From the foregoing, it is crystal clear that Ramadān fasting is mandatory on Muslims who already hold unto the four other pillars of Islam; the Kalimatu shahadah (acceptance of Allah as the only God and Muhammed as His messenger), Salāt (the daily prayer), Zakat (almsgiving) and Hajj (pilgrimage to the Holy Land) as prerequisites of Islam as a religion.  The entire Muslim community is currently in the euphoric mood of anticipation to embrace the fast-approaching holy month, but with necessary preparations which include getting one’s mind ready for the great act of ‘īmān (faith in Allah). Also, among the preparations is to readily ascertain provisions that will ease the task ahead of us.  However, the best of preparations is what Allah says in the Quran to be “Taqwa”(piety). “And take provisions, but indeed, the best provision is fear of Allah. And fear Me, O you of understanding”. Quran 2:197 The fear of Allah as a preparatory requirement towards the holy month of Ramadan entails, to mention but a few, the following:  With the above listed preparations, it is believed that every Muslim will have the prepared mindset to strive, relentlessly, towards seeking the face of Allah in the coming month of Ramadan, and we pray Allah, in His infinite mercy, bless Sha’bān for us and allow us reach the holy month of Ramadan.
