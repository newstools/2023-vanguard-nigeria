The Labour Party, LP in Delta state said the party is not in negotiation with the governor of the state, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa  The state chairman of the Party, Chief Tony Ezeagwu, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in an interview on Monday in Asaba. The party disassociated itself from rumours making the rounds that it is negotiating with the PDP governor ahead of the March 11 governorship election in the state.  According to Ezeagwu, there is no iota of truth in the rumours. He said that the party and its teeming supporters in the state remained resolute in their determination to win the governorship election come March 11 and would never divert its support to any other party. “The Labour Party in Delta held a meeting yesterday where we discussed the rumour making the rounds that our party candidate, Ken Pela, is a stooge to Gov. Okowa.  “The same rumour being peddled also alleged that my humble self has been settled with one million naira to surrender our support to the PDP.  “However, I want the general public to know that the Labour Party in Delta has no business with Gov. Okowa, the PDP or any other party in the state. “As a party, we have not discussed anything of such with Okowa, we have not even held any meeting with him and we don’t intend to do so”, Ezeagwu said.  The chairman advised the public, especially supporters of the Labour Party, to disregard the rumours. According to him, the rumour is being peddled by people who are envious of the popularity and general acceptance of the Labour Party in the state.  He said: “They are only spreading these rumours to disabuse the minds of our people from voting for the Labour Party because they are jittery of impending defeat in the hands of our party.  “Those spreading these rumours are simply terrified and afraid because they are being hunted by what the Labour Party did to them at the last presidential election.”   (NAN)
