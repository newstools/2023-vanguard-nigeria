When my husband lost his job a few years ago, we were afraid it would affect the education of our eldest child, who was at the university.  But she told us not to worry – that we should give her what we could afford and she would resort to some petty trading among the undergraduates to make ends meet. We were so proud of her resourcefulness – she’s worked hard to even have good grades. But last month, I ran into a friend of hers who confessed a few of them had sought the services of some Aristos, aka Sugar Daddies, to make ends meet. I was shocked, to say the least.  When I asked my daughter on her next visit to the house, she told me she’d fallen out with this friend and that was why she let the cat out of the bag. She didn’t deny what was alleged, however, but begged me not to tell her dad. I know if I did, the information would break his heart. So, how do I keep this awful secret?  Mutiat, by e-mail.  Dear Mutiat,  That your daughter admitted the truth of her indiscretion could be a cry for help – she probably wants you to find her a way out of the situation.   This should remain a secret between two adults, but you need to help her work out a better way to make ends meet. If your husband now has a job, this might help. If not, you might need to give her a helping hand by obtaining a soft loan that could help her out of this nightmarish situation she’s found herself.  Whatever you do, don’t judge her. What’s done is best left in the past.  (Share your problems and release your burden. Write now to Dear Bunmi: bunmsof@yahoo.co.uk)
