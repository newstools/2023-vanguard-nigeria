Popular musician and lawyer, Folarin Falana aka Falz has said celebrities fueling tribalism and bigotry during the electioneering period deserve the attacks they get on social media.  Falz, son of human rights activists and lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN) revealed this while appearing on ‘Breakfast Central’. He spoke on ‘The future of Nigeria politics and youth participation’. Remarking those bullied for making known their preferred candidates for public offices, the activist expressed disapproval, insisting everyone has the right to choose who they want to support.  He stated: “I find it funny but at the same time not funny because I see where people are coming from. For the one that have fuelled the tribalism and bigotry we spoke of earlier on. I say they hundred percent deserve the bullying they’re getting because that is stupid of them. It’s such an evil thing to put fuel. “I’ve seen celebrities that I thought had some sense in them, I’ve seen them blatantly fuelling this thing; this tribalism and bigotry in such a senseless manner. I think those ones deserved the bullying. “However, for the other people that have just come to say, ‘This is my preferred candidate’. Everyone of course, like we know, should be fully free from any attack. You know, I should be able to say, ‘This is my preferred candidate and I stand by that’.  “However, we know what we are going through as a country and we know the people that kept us here as a country. So, when those people come with their full chests and say, ‘This is who I support’, I see why people attack them.  “However, it’s not okay. Nobody should be bullied for their choice of candidate but those people too, they should think about it. Look at it, so far, it’s been going round. They too are feeling it.”
