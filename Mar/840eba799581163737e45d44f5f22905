Shubaki was accused of attempting to smuggle weapons from Iran to the coastal territory of the Gaza aboard the Karine A ship, which was seized by Israel in the Red Sea.  The Israeli military held the ship was carrying 50 tonnes of weapons, including short-range Katyusha rockets, anti-tank missiles and explosives from Iran and the Lebanese-based Hezbollah.
