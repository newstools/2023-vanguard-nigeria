Justice Bala Usman of the Federal High Court in Jalingo has affirmed Senator Emmanuel Bwacha as the Taraba state All Progressives Congress, APC governorship candidate for the March 18 election.  The court reaffirmed Bwacha as the duly elected candidate of the APC. Justice Usman noted that it is vital to uphold the judgement of the Supreme Court which has a consequential order directing the APC to have a fresh primary where Emmanuel emerged as the candidate of the party.  The court asserted the candidature of Bwacha while ruling on the case filed by the APC asking the INEC not to withdraw its candidate from its portal or ballot paper ahead of the governorship election.
