Confusion and uncertainty enveloped the CAF Confederation Cup match between Nigeria champions, Rivers United and Daring Motema Pembe Football club of D.R. Congo, originally billed for the Godswill Akpabio International stadium, Uyo, on Wednesday.  The non-arrival of the Congolese club in Nigeria led to the calling off of the match which is a reverse fixture between the two sides. Rivers United defeated Motema Pembe 1-0 away on matchday three. Ghana midfielder, Paul Acquah netted the winning goal early in the second half. The victory ensured they topped the group with six points, while Motema Pembe are 4th. Victory against the same opponent at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium, Uyo, would have seen the Stanley Eguma’s boys move to nine points in the Group B table and ensure their qualification to the next round.  There has been no official communication from CAF nor had there been any official communication between the Congolese side and their Nigerian hosts. Meanwhile, the Congolese club has issued a sketchy statement on its official website. The statement reads: “Rivers United’s CAF Confederation Cup tie with DC Motema Pembe has been postponed. An official communication is expected from CAF soon.”  The statement added, “that the game holds by 8pm on Thursday’.
