.  By Evelyn Usman, LAGOS Personnel of the 9 Brigade of the Nigerian Army, yesterday, recovered 1,671 Permanent Voters  Cards,  PVCs,  in an apartment in the Olodi-Apapa area of Lagos State.  Three persons were subsequently arrested in the apartment, while the prime suspect was said to be on the run. Also recovered in the apartment were ballot papers, cutlasses and Indian hemp. Vanguard gathered that the startling discovery was made in the course of a preliminary investigation into an incident that occurred in the area, yesterday.  The Brigade Commander, Brig. Gen. Isang Akpaumontia, who paraded the suspects and recovered PVCs, ballot papers and other items before journalists at the Ikeja Cantonment, said the arrest and recovery were made following a tip-off.  Most of the recovered PVCs had the year 2022 as the registration number, while others had years 2011, 2012 and 2021 with all the owners being residents of Lagos State.   Briefing journalists Akpaumontia said: “Earlier today (yesterday), three young men were arrested with 1,671 PVCs.  This was after early information was received. With the support of the Department of State Services, DSS, we were able to arrest them.  “They were arrested with some drugs, dagger, charms and over 1,000 PVCs.  They were arrested at the Apapa general area, in a house where we traced them to. The owner of the house, who is the prime suspect, was traced to a hotel. But he took off.  “We are going to hand these suspects and exhibits over to our immediate headquarters to do the needful because things have to be done the way they should, so as to discourage others who think they can take laws into their hands and go scot-free.”
