Erica Herman, the ex-lover of Tiger Woods, has sued the athlete over a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) she claimed she was “forced to sign.”  She said that she is now entitled to 30 million dollars in compensation following their split. In court documents obtained by Daily Mail, Woods was accused of unlawfully locking Herman out of their shared Florida home.  Herman claimed the NDA should be voided when there is evidence of assault or harassment. She cited the Speak Out Act which states: “an NDA is not enforceable if agreed to before a dispute involving sexual assault or sexual harassment.” She claimed she is being coerced to adhere ro the agreement by a private trust run by Woods.  Herman alleged the golf legend, 47, tricked her into packing her bag for a “short vacation”, only to be told that she has been kicked out when she arrived at the airport.  Herman claimed they had an “oral agreement” that meant she could live at the mansion for eleven years, of which she had five years remaining when they ended their romance.  In the legal filings, Herman used the word “trickery”, which she said violates the oral tenancy agreement and Florida law.  Herman and Woods started dating in August 2017. They ended the relationship after six years. The ex-lovers have not been seen in public since the US Open tennis tournament in August 2022.
