By Awobiyi Seyifunmi  Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri is firm about the restoration of injury-delayed Paul Pogba. The Frenchman is likely to star in Juve’s squad ahead of the Turin Derby against Torino.  This is the closest he has been to make a long-awaited second inception for the Old Lady following the knee injury he sustained during pre-season action. The injury even scratched the 29-year-old chances of assisting France to defend their World Cup in the closing stages of 2022. Allegri told the reporters regarding the World Cup winner’s fitness: “He’s feeling better and he’s been called up for tomorrow’s game. “If necessary, we’ll play him. We know he won’t have much playing time, but he can play.  “I’ve talked to him like I have all the others.  “He understands it’s an important part of the season to get back to playing. He must remain motivated to help us finish the season well,” he ended.  The Italian boss is willing to give Pogba some minutes after seven months of being absent from the football world. The Juventus side are currently eighth and still in the fight to reach an European spot before seasons end following their 15 point deduction.
