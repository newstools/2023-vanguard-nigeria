.  The Lagos PDP governorship candidate, Dr Abdul-Azeez Adediran (Jandor), says there should be no reason for violence in any part of the state following the outcome of Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections. Adediran made the call in a statement by Mr Gbenga Ogunleye, the Head, Media and Communications, JANDOR4GOVERNOR Campaign Organisation, on Monday in Lagos.  The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the collated results on Monday in the state favoured the Labour Party as against the ruling All Progressives Congress. There were cases of violence in some parts of the state reportedly instigated by those who were not comfortable with the outcome of the polls. The candidate, who condemned alleged attacks on some non-indigenes in the state, said that the results should be accepted in good faith. “I call on the good people of the state to continue to keep the peace and remain resolute on their readiness to change the government in the state through their voting in the March 11 guber election,” he said.  Decrying what he described as inhuman treatment meted on the electorate by political thugs in some local government areas of the states, Adediran called on Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu to condemn such attacks and beef up security around the areas the attacks were happening.  The candidate recalled that his team also on Sunday paid a visit and extended support to one Mrs Bina Jennifer Efidi, one of the victims of the political attacks on Saturday in the Surulere area of the state.  He said that Efidi was wounded by suspected thugs at her polling unit during the presidential and National Assembly election on Saturday. Adeniran also condoled the people who had been attacked and had suffered the loss of property in the fraca.
