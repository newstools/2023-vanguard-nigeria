The Atiku/Okowa Campaign Organisation has demanded that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) cancel all collated results so far and declare the election inconclusive.  The campaign spokesman, Daniel Bwala said this in a statement on Tuesday. Bwala explained that the election has been blighted by irregularities, noting it is a “total departure from the Electoral Act Amendment”.  The statement reads, “Section 65 of the Electoral Act mandates the INEC chairman to correct every anomaly (s) raised by stakeholders of the process (political party and their agents) within 7 days. “Suspend national collation immediately and address the complaints raised by parties relating to BVAS bypass and electronic transmission of results. “Set a date for the conduct of elections in the affected places and ensure results are uploaded as contained in the guidelines. The said elections must be free and fair and BVAS used accordingly  “Cancel all the collated and announced results so far until such a time when all the results collated at the polling units alone be uploaded to INEC server, same ONLY NE ANNOUNCED, duplicate copies of which all party agents have for transparency sake.  “Declare this election inconclusive and set a date for conduct of elections that addresses areas where BVAS was not used and where violence occurred which suppress the voting rights of the people.”
