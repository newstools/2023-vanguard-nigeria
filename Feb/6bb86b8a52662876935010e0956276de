By Awobiyi Seyifunmi  Chelsea representatives have reportedly given Graham Potter two games to save his managerial spot at the club. The next two games that will decide the future of the Englishman will be a league game against Leeds United and a Champions League tie against Borussia Dortmund.  Potter has not been in perfect sync at the London club winning only nine times in 26 matches since replacing Thomas Tuchel in September. The loss to Tottenham Hotspur was their third consecutive loss and the third game in a row without a goal. Their only goal of the month came from Joao Felix against West Ham United.  Despite the exuberant spending on new attacking recruits, the club is winless since the close of the transfer window.  The only trophy that could come to Stamford Bridge this season is the Champions League and are currently trailing by a goal against BVB with the second league yet to be played.
