By Ozioruva Aliu BENIN CITY – THE governor of Edo state, Godwin Obaseki has described Wednesday’s Supreme Court decision on the crisis in Edo State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over candidates for the 2023 elections as a case of “no victor, no vanquished”   In a statement released late Wednesday, Obaseki said “The ruling of the Supreme Court today, finally put to rest the long-drawn legal tussle over the candidates that will fly the flag of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Edo State in the general election on the 25th of February and 11th of March 2023   “As the leader of the party in the State, I implore all members to consider this development as the end of all strife within the Edo PDP and to note that this is a victory for all members. Our resolve now is to win the forthcoming general elections as this experience has made us stronger and better prepared to clinch victory.   “This disagreement which has now been amicably resolved attests to the maturity of actors who as law-abiding party members have subjected themselves to and accepted the verdict of the courts.   “As there are no victors or vanquished in this issue, I want to call on all members of our party to come together to speak with one voice against the real opponents since our party is big enough to accommodate our variegated interests.   “The ongoing crisis in our Nation which has been choreographed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) is subjecting Nigerians to perhaps the most tortuous living conditions in our history since the Civil War between 1967 and 1970. Our efforts must now be directed to removing the APC from power and restoring our blessed Country.   “I, therefore, call on all our members in Edo State to stand up and be counted among the brave party men and women who stood to be counted in the execution of this all-important task to rescue Nigeria and pull it back from the precipice.”  THE governor of Edo state, Godwin Obaseki has described Wednesday's Supreme Court decision on the crisis in Edo State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over candidates for the 2023 elections as a case of "no victor, no vanquished" In "News" By Ozioruva Aliu BENIN CITY – THERE were mixed reactions in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State yesterday as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) released the list of candidates for the Senate and House of Representatives election in Edo State which produced all the candidates that emerged… In "News" The Supreme Court, yesterday, declined jurisdiction to hear the internal dispute rocking the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Edo State.  In "News"
