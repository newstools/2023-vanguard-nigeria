There was mild drama on Monday at the National Collation Centre in Abuja when National Agent of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), former Senator Dino Melaye contested the results presented on the floor of the centre.  Melaye had on Monday observed that the results announced for Ekiti State on Sunday where candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) won did not tally with the overall figures.  He (Melaye) therefore requested that the results be projected live on screen while being read by the State Coalition Officer for the Presidential Election (SCOPE) and Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) of the presenting state.  Responding, the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Mahmood Yakub said Melaye’s observation was noted and would be acted upon. He said most of the observations made by Melaye and other party agents were supposed to have been presented and rectified at the ward, local and state collation centres.  Melaye, however, protested, insisting that his observation be implemented before results from other states are taken.  The INEC boss cautioned Melaye saying ‘You’re now deliberately being disruptive’.
