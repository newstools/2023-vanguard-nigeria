Manchester City have offered a contract extension with an improved salary to Argentine forward, Julián Álvarez.  Alvarez has recently emerged in transfer talks with Barcelona having indicated interest in snapping up the 23-year-old forward. According to El Chiringuito, Alvarez has informed Manchester City that he is keen to switch allegiances this summer. He is hoping to secure a move to a European club, where he will be a key first-team starter.  Earlier, Alvarez was reported to be interested in a potential loan switch. However, with no change in his game-time due to Haaland’s presence, he is in favor of a permanent transfer away from Pep Guardiola’s side. However, according to Italian journalist, Fabrizio Romano confirmed, “Manchester City have offered Julian Alvarez a contract renewal, but there is no agreement yet because the player’s side has not given the green light. Talks will continue until the summer but he could explore other possibilities if no deal is done by then.” Since joining City from River Plate for £14 million in 2022, Alvarez has registered 10 goals and two assists in 13 starts.  He was also pivotal to Argentine’s World Cup glory in Qatar, netting four times, including three knockout goals, and laid out one assist in seven overall matches in the famed tournament.
