On-form Super Eagles and Napoli forward, Victor Osimhen is set to pocket N120m if he reaches 30 goals for the Parthenopeans in the ongoing 2022/23 season.  According to Italian media La Gazzetta dello Sport, the forward recently activated his goals bonus in his contract after scoring his 20th goal of the season, which saw him earn €130,000 (N64m) The 24-year-old was on the scoresheet in Napoli’s 2-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League round of 16, taking his tally for the season to 20 and thereby unlocking the €130,000 bonus (N63.6m).  Osimhen has been pivotal in Napoli’s high-flying performance in the ongoing season, scoring 21 goals and providing four assists in 25 games for the Naple-side. “He (Osimhen) has already hit his first contractual bonus, which included a €130,000 bonus upon reaching 20 goals. But at this rate, Victor risks making blows because the same figure starts at the 25th and also at the 30th goals,” La Gazzetta hello Sport stated. “Objectives that become decidedly within the reach of a great striker who has achieved these 21 goals in just 25 games. There are at least 15 challenges ahead and probably they can become 17, dreaming of being able to reach 20, which would mean going to play the Champions League final in Istanbul.”  Osimhen has at least 15 games to reach 30 goals this season and looks to reach that milestone considering his goals form and if he is fit.
