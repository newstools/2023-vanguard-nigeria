Ifeanyichukwu Ibezi has denied sponsoring the gruesome killings in the state. Ibezi was reacting to a video produced by one Chukwuka Ofoegbu, a.k.a Ijele, accusing him of being behind the heinous murders in Anambra state. Denying the allegation in a statement signed by Mr. Ubaka Onwuanibe , on behalf of  Ibezi Media Team, Hon. Ibezi averred: “What the producer and sponsor of the infantile and mendacious video did not bother to tell their listeners is the motive Hon. Ibezi may have had to sponsor such heinous crimes in Anambra. Why would Hon. Ifeanyichukwu Ibezi sponsor the death of the people the anonymous caller in the video mentioned. “Could those unfortunate victims, who were not even from Idemili North and South Federal Constituency, and who were not politicians in any way, have stood in the way of Ibezi’s political career? What value was their death to the progress or otherwise of Hon Ibezi’s politics?  “For the avoidance of doubt, Hon. Ifeanyichukwu Ibezi has never and will never be part of any plot to maim or kill anybody. Given the seriousness of the allegations, Hon. Ibezi has already briefed appropriate security agencies and his lawyers over this unsavory development. “Rather than be distracted, Hon. Ifeanyichukwu Ibezi will continue his intense and grassroots-focused campaigns in the 17 communities of Idemili, which have endeared him to Umu Idemili. Opponents should understand that 2023 election will be different and the electorate are wiser. Only achievements will count before them and not mudslinging. “Hon. Ibezi wishes to thank many Nigerians, Ndi Anambra and Umu Idemili who have called to express their concerns and support. He reiterates his pledge to ensure robust, quality and effective representation if elected to represent the good people of Idemili North and South Federal Constituency at the 10th National Assembly come February 25, 2023.”  A FORMER member of the House of Representatives for Idemili North and South Federal Constituency of Anambra State, Hon Ifeanyi Ibezi has called on supporters and stakeholders of All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) in Idemili area to close ranks and prepare for the important task of electing the next governor… In "Politics" The Police in Anambra State has launched a manhunt for members of two rival cult groups allegedly responsible for the untimely death of two suspected cult members at Obosi, Idemili North Local Government Area, Anambra State and the country home of the former Commonwealth Secretary-General, Chief Emeka Anyaoku.
