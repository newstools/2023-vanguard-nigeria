The Lagos State Public Police Relations Officer, SP Benjamin Hundeyin has said reports of alleged attacks in ‘Igbo traders’ in the state on Monday morning is fake.  The Police image maker in Lagos State was reacting to reports of alleged attacks on some traders in Lagos Island by hoodlums over the electoral victory of presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi in the state.  Lagos State is largely regarded as strong hold of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu.  Narrating what happened at the market on Monday, Hundeyin via his verified Twitter handle said: ‘the market association agreed that shops would remain closed yesterday and today. Igbo traders this morning decided to renege on the agreement and open shops. Some hoodlums took it upon themselves to enforce compliance. The police was alerted.’ The police arrived promptly. The hoodlums fled upon sighting police patrol vans. Not one shop was vandalized. Not one person was robbed. Not one person was injured. Normalcy was swiftly returned and officers remain on ground.
