Grammy award-winning afrobeats star, Damini Ogulu popularly known as Burna Boy, has disclosed why he has been quiet about the 2023 elections.  Burna Boy had recently come under fire on social media for not being vocal on critical issues that have played out in the ongoing 2023 elections unlike some of his colleagues. Criticisms spotlighted his song ‘20.10.20’ where he berated the government for their actions during the #EndSARS protests and Lekki Massacre, telling him off for not translating such activism in reality.  Clarifying why he distances himself from politics, the Ye crooner took to his Instagram page on Monday, to reveal that he does not believe in any of the candidates running for political posts. He cited that none of the candidate or party could be trusted to deliver their campaign promise, hence will not want to lead people on to voting for a candidate that will dissapoint. “I don’t know why it’s such a big deal to some Nigerians that I’ve not been vocal about the elections,” he wrote on his Instagram stories.  “Personally I don’t have a candidate that I believe in. I’ve never supported any political party or candidate in my life because I don’t want to make you vote and then blame me when the person f**ks up as usual. That being said, I hope all votes count and the best man wins.”
