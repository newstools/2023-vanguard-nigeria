Popular standup comedian, Bright Okpocha popularly called Basketmouth, has explained why he did not vote in the Presidential and National Assembly elections that held nationwide on Saturday in Nigeria.  The comedian gave his reasons via his Instagram account on Monday. He stated that he had shows outside of Nigeria planned for a year in advance to secure a good venue and that changing venues due to the election date would cause him logistical problems.   “ I have always spoken up about the wrongs in this country. It’s quite unfortunate that I missed elections this year. However, my international shows are planned one year before, so as to secure the date and venue. “ To have changed my date on such short notice would have been a logistical hazard not to myself but to the whole crew. Elections have not always been in February. But my show always was, as a valentine special. “ That being said, I am proud of every Nigerian Youth for taking a stand. Thank you to my true fans that understood and still came out for me. Thank you Frankfrut for another sold out show. Cologne. You are next “
