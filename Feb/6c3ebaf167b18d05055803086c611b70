By Biodun Busari   Twitter CEO, Elon Musk has regained his title as the world’s richest man after briefly losing it to the LVMH French businessman, Bernard Arnault.  Arnault, the CEO of the French luxury brand, Louis Vuitton, dethroned the Tesla boss, by edging him to the number two spot for more than two months.  Meanwhile, according to Bloomberg, a surge in Tesla stock has placed Musk back to the top of the Billionaires Index. As of Monday, February 28, after the markets closed, Musk’s net worth was approximately $187.1 billion, surpassing Arnault’s $185.3 billion fortune. Musk’s wealth was boosted nearly 70% surge in Tesla Inc.’s stock price this year, about 100% from its intraday low on January 6 as investors pile back into bets on riskier growth stocks amid signs of economic strength and a slower pace of Federal Reserve interest-rate increases.  The company has also benefited from more demand for its electric vehicles after cutting prices on several models.
