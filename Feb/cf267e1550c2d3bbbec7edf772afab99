By Awobiyi Seyifunmi  Barcelona manager, Xavi Hernandez, was left sizzling after his side suffered a 1-0 La Liga loss to relegation nominees Almeria on Sunday evening. The home side dumbfounded the leaders when Almerienses forward El Bilal Toure scored the only goal in the first half.  Xavi roasted his players declaring this was his team’s most dissatisfying performance this season. The Catalan boss told reporters: “This was our worst match of the season. I’m very pissed off. It was too difficult,” he remarked. “We weren’t there. We weren’t inside the match. There are no excuses today. We didn’t deserve to win and we have to take responsibility. I’m very pissed off. “We lacked passion in the first half. In the second half, we tried everything… 3-4-3, Araujo as a striker… Nothing.  “It wasn’t meant to be. It was not enough. It will cost us the league title if we don’t change our mental chip now.”  The loss inflicted on the table toppers has now dropped their eight-point lead to a seven-point lead ahead of second-place Real Madrid.  This is Barca’s first loss since October which was at the Santiago Bernabéu where they lost 3-1. Barcelona’s next match will be against Real Madrid in the first leg of the Cope del Ray semi-finals.
