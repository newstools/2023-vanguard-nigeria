By Biodun Busari  Some youths have stormed the National Collation Centre of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, in Abuja on Monday to protest the election results declared so far. The protesting youths arrived at the International Conference Centre to register their grievances while the collation of the presidential election was being conducted by the INEC.  Some of the youth displayed placards that read: “BeingbackIREV, no IREV no collation,” “Nigeria not for sale, we fight for justice,” “INEC keep your promises” among others. There have been some allegations and counter-allegations by major political parties concerning the collation and announcement of the results of the presidential election conducted on Saturday. Earlier, Vanguard reported that the collation agent of the Peoples Democratic Party and former Kogi Senator, Dino Melaye and his other party’s agents walked out of NCC, as well. Before staging a walkout, Melaye had earlier called on the INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu to ensure that uploaded results must be displayed on the screen before the electoral umpire could progress.  The former Kogi Senator protested that the results from Ekiti would not be accepted by his PDP, citing discrepancies as he argued that results could be cancelled because they were presented and not declared.  While Yakubu maintained that Melaye and PDP could only present their grievances at the Election Tribunal while they continue with the collation and announcement of election results, Melaye said the results could not stand  At the reconvening of the INEC at the NCC, Melaye made his earlier grievance known, but the INEC chair stood his ground, which infuriated the former lawmaker and stormed out of the hall with his cronies.
