Former presidential candidate of the African Democratic Party, ADC, Kingsley Moghalu has said his experience in the political terrain in Nigeria made him quit partisan politics.  The former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) said Nigeria is not ready for full democracy owing to several factors including corruption, poverty, illiteracy, amongst others.  Moghalu shortly after the conclusion of the presidential and national assembly elections in Nigeria on Saturday took to his verified Twitter account to share his opinion on conduct of the poll.  Disappointed that @inecnigeria , despite all assurances they gave us, has disappointed again. “Tactical disenfranchisement”. Police colluding with thugs. Delayed uploading of results to BVAS. Whether it’s just operational incapacity, human factor, or more, the result is the same. The people showed enthusiasm but the system let them down in too many polling units – delayed arrivals of INEC officials, violence in certain states, delayed uploading of results. I see SANS on parade ahead.
