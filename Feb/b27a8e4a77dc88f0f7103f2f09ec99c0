By Miftaudeen Raji   The Labour Party, LP, has insisted that its national collation agent will not be returning to the National Collation Centre of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, when it resumes election collation proceedings later today (Tuesday). A spokesperson for Peter Obi, Datti Baba-Ahmed Presidential Campaign Council, Ndi Kato, stated this in an interview with Arise TV, on Tuesday  She stated, “The walk-out at the National Collation Centre yesterday (Monday) is enough of a statement and it stands.”  Recall that the agents of major opposition parties at the national collation centre in Abuja, on Monday, walked out of the venue in protest at the exercise. Dino Melaye and Emeka Ihedioha of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP had accused the INEC of violating the Electoral Act by going ahead with the result collation and announcement despite not uploading the results on the iREV portal.  Similarly, agents of some other parties, including those of the Social Democratic Party, SDP, and Action Democratic Party, ADP had also joined the walkout.   Melaye said, “We are not here to rubber stamp the electoral fraud that has been declared by INEC and APC, Mr Melaye told journalists after the election.  “INEC is compromised. APC has influenced INEC,” he said.
