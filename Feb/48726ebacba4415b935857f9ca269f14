By Biodun Busari The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said 160,000 children acquired the Human Immunodeficiency Virus in 2020, according to 2021 HIV and AIDS Global Snapshot on Wednesday. The humanitarian aid organisation also revealed in a report, yesterday, that at least one child dies from AIDS-related causes every five minutes globally. “Children under 15 years of age account for about 5 per cent of all people living with HIV, 10 per cent of new HIV infections and 15 per cent of all AIDS-related deaths, globally,” UNICEF said.
