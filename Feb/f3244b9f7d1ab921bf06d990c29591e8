The Speaker of the ECOWAS parliament, Sidie Mohammed Tunis, speaking at the closing of the fifth Legislature of ECOWAS Parliament Extraordinary session in Guinea Bissau urged the country to uphold the spirit and tenets of sportsmanship, transparency, and accountability in the polls. He said “Permit me to reiterate my earlier calls on our brothers and sisters in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and other Member States who are going into major elections this year, to uphold the spirit and tenets of sportsmanship, transparency, and accountability. “Let us bear in mind that election is not a do or die affair, rather it provides a golden opportunity for our citizens to cast their votes to elect credible leaders of their choice and not disrupt the electoral processes through violence and destruction of lives and properties. I appeal to all the citizens of these countries to uphold the principles of democracy and respect opposing opinions. Let´s be guided that the days of violence and wanton destruction of lives and properties after the declaration of the election results, will no longer be tolerated and the wish of the majority must prevail. In addition, any candidates who feel otherwise should seek redress in the court of law and follow due process. “I urge all stakeholders in charge of organizing and conducting elections, especially Heads of Electoral Commissions, Security Agencies and Non-State Actors to ensure that the outcome of the elections is rooted in transparency and social justice.” Tunis also urged everyone to put hands on deck to ensure that West Africa moves in the direction of progress. “I want to task and equally encourage all and sundry to remain focused and resilient towards our common goal of ensuring that our region prospers.  Remember that our destinies are in our hands, and we can determine the means to arrive at our desired success. I am hopeful that at the end of this year, we will be on the positive and bright side of life,” he added. The Speaker said the parliamentary session enabled them to hold qualitative discussions and adopt workable conclusions on pressing issues affecting the people in the region. “It is therefore hoped that the recommendations made during this Session will form the basis for policy formulations, implementations and produce outcomes needed to transform the standard of living of our people.  The year 2023 presents a huge opportunity for us to re-evaluate issues militating against the shared developments of our Member States.” Resolutions from the ECOWAS Parliamentary seminar were also adopted, with recommendations for ECOWAS Member States to intensify efforts to meet the related convergence criteria stipulated between 2022 and 2026, in order to be adequately prepared for the launch of the single currency threshold program by 2027.
